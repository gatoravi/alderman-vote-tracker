Resolution No. 38

Pacific Educational Group’s

Fifth Annual Summit for
Courageous Conversation
WHEREAS, the team of dedicated and
talented staff of Pacific Educational Group
has  partnered  with  school  districts,
universities and educational organizations
throughout the U.S., Canada and Australia in
fostering  the  development  of  greater
awareness,  skills  and  accountability  in

educating  all  students  and  especially
underserved students of color since 1992; and
WHEREAS,  U.S. educational statistics
have shown that racial achievement disparities
in public education have persisted for nearly
a century, and current data indicates that (a)
even low-income White students consistently
outperform their middle and upper income
Black,  Brown,  Native American/Alaska
Native and Hawaiian Native/Pacific Island
counterparts, and (b) educational achievement
disparities  between  White  students  and
students of color have reached unprecedented,
alarmingly high levels; and

WHEREAS, Pacific Educational Group
believes  that  systemic  racism  is  the  most
devastating  factor  contributing  to  the
diminished capacity of children of color to
achieve at the highest levels, and contributes
to  the  fracturing  of  the  communities  that
nurture and support them; and

WHEREAS, the staff and affiliates of
Pacific Educational Group strive to prepare
leaders, be they governing board members,
administrators, teachers, students, parents or
community  members,  to  be  effective  and
courageous advocates for eliminating the racial
predictability of which student groups occupy
the highest and lowest achievement categories;
and

WHEREAS, the Summit for Courageous
Conversation  convenes  leaders  for  racial
equity from the U.S. and around the world to
engage, sustain and deepen interracial dialogue
about the impact of race on schooling and to
discover effective strategies for unlocking the
untapped potential of underserved children
of color and their White peers.

NOW  THEREFORE  BE 

IT
RESOLVED by the Board of Aldermen of
the City of St. Louis that we pause in our
deliberations to recognize Pacific Educational
Group’s Fifth Annual Summit for Courageous
Conversation and we further direct the Clerk
of  this  Board  to  spread  a  copy  of  this
Resolution  across  the  minutes  of  these
proceedings and to prepare a commemorative
copy to the end that it may be presented to
our  honoree  at  a  time  and  place  deemed

Honorable Chris Carter, Alderman 27th Ward

Resolution No. 39
Christy Connor

WHEREAS,  Christy  Connor  has
established a tradition of excellence in her small,
St. Louis school. She’s put in countless hours
with  her  middle  school  students  for  the

National History Day competition and has
mentored  several  top-finishing  student
projects over her 20 years as a social studies
educator,  all  while  retaining  superior
performance in the classroom; and

WHEREAS, National History Day is a
state- and national-level competition in which
students choose historical topics and conduct
extensive primary and secondary research with
the support of their committed teachers; and
WHEREAS,  Connor,  a  6-8th  grade
Social  Studies  teacher  at  St.  Raphael  the
Archangel School in St. Louis, Mo., has a
record for top-honored students at the state
contest (who then go on to compete at the
national level). During her time participating
in National History Day, Connor has helped
students  select  topics,  conduct  hours  of
research,  synthesize  their  findings,  and
present an engaging, finished product; and

WHEREAS,  undertaking a National
History  Day  project  is  a  major  time
commitment  for  both  students  and  their
mentors.  Connor  volunteers  above  and
beyond what’s expected of most teachers,
staying after school with her students every
day from October through May and even on
Saturdays to guide them in their projects. She
also gives her time as a judge for other schools
at the state competition where she provides
thoughtful  commentary  and  helps  other
students make their work stronger; and

WHEREAS, the most remarkable aspect
of her students’ great success in state and
national competition is that they come from a
school  with  less  than  200  Kindergarten
through eighth-grade students. In such a small
school,  Connor  has  created  a  culture  of
excellence; and

WHEREAS, her impact is not limited
to National History Day. Despite all the time
she puts in after school, Connor still maintains
a high standard of excellence in her regular
social studies classes; and

WHEREAS, Connor’s students build a
sense of pride and accomplishment over their
years with her. With her guidance, students
develop  attributes  crucial  for  their  future
success, such as critical thinking and problem-
solving skills, research and reading skills, oral
and written communication skills, and a sense
of responsibility; and

WHEREAS,  after  40  years  as  an
educator  and  20  years  of  teaching  social
studies, Connor is an exemplary woman of
character. St. Raphael the Archangel School
may be small, but nothing about Connor’s time
there has been.
