luncheon  on  Sunday,  May  5,  will  bring
together over 300 graduates, community and

the 130 years that St. Nicholas has served
downtown St. Louis residents; and

WHEREAS, opened in 1867 by German
Catholics, the church and school became the
first and only parish in the city to focus on
educating and improving the lives of African
Americans. In 1923, Jesuit scholars took over
the reigns of the church and built an elementary
and high school.  For years, the church served
residents of neighboring Carr Square Village
and Vaugh Apartments. Today, although the
schools have been closed, the church and a
preschool continue to serve residents of St.
Louis including expanded areas that have been
impacted by other church closures; and

Urey Patrick Mark; and

which provides quality day care and academic
instruction to hundreds of preschool kids each
year; and

WHEREAS, since 1926 St. Nicholas and
the St. Louis African American community
have  grown  together  and  through  myriad
economic  and  demographic  changes,  St.
Nicholas  continues  to  provide  a  haven  for
worship, council, education and recreation to
many. Best known for its famed skating rink,
St. Nicholas was “home” to thousands as it
provided a safe and nurturing environment
replete with the kind of religious instruction
that prepared its graduates to blossom and
excel.

Resolution No. 12

Mayor Freeman Bosley Jr.
WHEREAS, April 20th, 2013 marked
the twentieth anniversary of the inauguration
of Freeman R. Bosley, Jr. as the forty-seventh
and the first African-American Mayor of the
City of St. Louis; and

WHEREAS, Freeman Bosley Jr. won
his first citywide elected office in 1982, when
he became the first African American to serve
as St. Louis Circuit Clerk for the 22nd Judicial
Circuit; and

WHEREAS, Mr. Bosley Jr. also served
as the first African American chairman of the
St. Louis Democratic Party; and

WHEREAS, after only a few months of
his historic mayoral victory, Mayor Bosley
faced a daunting test which he passed with
flying colors - the great flood of 1993.  As
Mayor, he made all the right decisions and
put in the hard work to minimize the effects
the natural disaster had on residents of the
city of St. Louis; and

WHEREAS,  Mayor  Freeman  Bosley
Jr.’s many notable and successful achievements
still bear fruit for the residents of the city of
St. Louis and the surrounding metropolitan
area to this day; and

WHEREAS, Mayor Bosley coordinated
the $70 million buyout of Trans World Airlines
(TWA)  and  the  move  of  their  world
headquarters to St. Louis, played a major role
in getting the St. Louis Rams football team to
move  to  St.  Louis  in  1995,  and    also
spearheaded the creation of the Forest Park
Master Plan; and

WHEREAS, Mayor Bosley understood
that it takes an operating budget to properly
run and manage a city like St. Louis.  After
many unsuccessful attempts by the previous
mayor to pass a sales tax increase to increase
the  city’s  budget,  Freeman  Bosley  Jr.’s
popularity in the African American community
and the goodwill he gained by his management
of  the  flood  that  affected  south  St.  Louis
allowed him to get sales tax increases passed

that  provided  more  funding  for  capital
improvements  and  the  general  operating
budget.    Without  those  additional  funding
sources, the city of St. Louis would not be
able to provide the level of service that it does
today.

NOW  THEREFORE  BE 

IT
RESOLVED by the Board of Aldermen of
the City of St. Louis that we pause in our
deliberations to recognize the 20th anniversary
of  the  inauguration  of  Mayor  Freeman  R.
Bosley Jr. and we wish him continued success,
achievement  and  accomplishment  and  we
further direct the Clerk of this Board to spread
