COURTESY RESOLUTIONS

CONSENT CALENDAR

 President Reed introduced Resolutions
No. 53 through 71 and  No. 73 through 74 and
the Clerk was instructed to read same.
Resolution Number 53

Bertha Gilkey-Bonds

WHEREAS, we pause to express our
sadness and offer condolences to the family
of  our  long-time  friend  and  community
organizer, Bertha Gilkey-Bonds, who was
called to her reward on May 24, 2014; and

WHEREAS, Bertha Knox Gilkey was
born in Arkansas on March 18th, 1948, to
Willie and Irma Robinson; she moved to St.
Louis in her early teens and was living with
her  mother  in  Cochran  Gardens,  a  public
housing complex, near downtown; and

WHEREAS, by 1969 she was active
with  tenants  in  a  rent  strike  to  improve
conditions at the embattled housing complex,

which  was  part  of  a  city-wide  group
protesting issues at the St. Louis Housing
Authority; and

WHEREAS, Bertha was so passionate
about  improving  the  living  conditions  of
residents of public housing and low income
families that she served on a citywide Tenant
Affairs Board and was elected to head the
Cochran Tenant Management Organization
after being instrumental in persuading the city
of St. Louis to move it to a tenant management
model in 1976; and

WHEREAS, Bertha Gilkey was always
committed to the idea that just because people
are low- income that did not mean they should
not have the same level of services that people
with  money  had,  so  she  organized  the
community to make history reforming public
housing in St. Louis and across the nation;
and

WHEREAS,  the  Cochran  Tenant
Management Corporation became the first of
its kind in St. Louis. In a short time the new
management rehabilitated Cochran Gardens
into a relatively safe and comfortable place.
Since 1978 the complex was modernized and
outfitted with new engineering systems, owing
both  to  Gilkey’s  fundraising  skills  and  to
Cochran’s  nearly  downtown  location  that
could  not  be  ignored  by  city  and  federal

National Geospatial-Intelligence

Agency Prioritization

of St. Louis City location

WHEREAS,  on  June  4,  2014  the
National  Geospatial-Intelligence Agency
(NGA) Chief News and Information Officer
Christine  Phillips  confirmed  the  agency’s
plans to close its South City operations center
and relocate more than 3,000 of its St. Louis

site, with many possible locations outside of
the city of St. Louis; and

WHEREAS, our elected officials and
development agency work diligently to retain
and grow businesses within the city of St.
Louis in an effort to increase the job base, and
NGA is currently one of the largest employers
in the city; and

WHEREAS, The 3,000 jobs housed at
the  current  NGA  location  are  vital  to  the
economic  health  of  the  city  of  St.  Louis,
through earning tax revenues and economic
support  of  surrounding  businesses  and
restaurants; and

WHEREAS,  the  movement  of  the
agency outside of our urban core contrasts
with smart growth principles that encourage
investment in high density areas that are easily
accessible to mass transit; and

WHEREAS, the Board of Aldermen
understands and appreciates the importance
of the  agency’s mission  in regards  to our
national security and intelligence and have long
been proud of its location right here in our
city; and

WHEREAS, if the NGA and the city
work diligently together for a solution, the
federal government’s considerations of zoning,

suitability and quality of site can be met within
the boundaries of the city of St. Louis; and

NOW  THEREFORE  BE 

IT
RESOLVED by the Board of Aldermen of
the City of St. Louis that we request the NGA
to make keeping these jobs within the City of
St.  Louis  a  top  priority  as  they  consider
relocation sites and we further direct the Clerk
of  this  Board  to  spread  a  copy  of  this
Resolution  across  the  minutes  of  these
