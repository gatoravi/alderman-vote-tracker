In accordance with Ordinance No. 65597, the
St.  Louis  Living  Wage  Ordinance
(“Ordinance”) and the Regulations associated
therewith, the City Compliance Official for
the City of St. Louis has determined that the
following living wage rates are now in effect
for employees of covered contracts:

1) Where health benefits as defined in
the Ordinance are provided to the
employee, the living wage rate is
$12.37 per hour (130% of the federal
poverty level income guideline for a
family of three); and

2) Where health benefits as defined in
the Ordinance are not provided to
the employee, the living wage rate is
$16.18 per hour (130% of the federal
poverty level income guideline for a
family of three, plus fringe benefit
rates as defined in the Ordinance).

3) Wages required under Chapter 6.20
of the Revised Code of the City of
St. Louis:  $3.81 per hour.

These rates are based upon federal poverty
level  income  guidelines  as  defined  in  the
Ordinance and these rates are effective as of
April 1, 2014. These rates will be further
adjusted periodically when the federal poverty
level income guideline is adjusted by the U.S.
Department of Health and Human Services or
pursuant to Chapter 6.20 of the Revised Code
of the City of St. Louis.
The Ordinance applies to employers who are
covered by the Ordinance as defined in the
Ordinance,  where  the  contract  or  grant  is
entered into or renewed after the effective date
of the Ordinance, which is November 3, 2002.

A. Proposals shall be opened at the time
and place fixed by the advertisement, in the
presence  of  such  bidders  as  desire  to  be
present, and shall be open to the inspection
of bidders.

B.  The  bids  shall  not  be  materially
modified or amended as to price, specification
or otherwise, nor substitutions placed thereon,
after opening except when the lowest bid is
from a non-local bidder. When the lowest bid
is from a non-local bidder, any local bidder
within two percent of the lowest bid may
match the lowest bid. If a local bidder matches
the lowest bid, then the Supply Commissioner
may select the bid from the local bidder. If
more  than  one  local  bidder  is  within  two
percent of the lowest bid, then only the lowest
local bidder may match the bid. In all other

had a valid business license for at least one
year, and is current in payment of local taxes.

the business’s physical office, plant, or site
where  a  majority  (51%)  of  the  full-time
employees, chief officer, and managers of the
business regularly work and conduct business,
or where the plant or office and equipment
required for the furnishing of the goods or
performance of the services provided to the
City, as required by the contract, are physically
located in the City of St. Louis for at least one
taxable year immediately prior to the date of
the bid.

C. Bids may be for one or more or all the
articles advertised for, but there shall be a
specific bid on each article. The award may be
made to the lowest bidder for any article, or
to the lowest bidder for the entire requisition
or  any  part  thereof,  but  the  Board  of
Standardization may reject any or all bids or
any part of any bid.
