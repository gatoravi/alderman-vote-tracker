FIRST READING OF

RESOLUTIONS

Ms. Ingrassia introduced Resolution No.
235 and the Clerk was instructed to read same.

Resolution No. 235

“Right to Work”

WHEREAS,  many  hard-working
families in the United States are in a constant
struggle to meet basic financial needs and goals;
and

WHEREAS, America has a growing
problem  with  income  inequality,  as  the
wealthiest one-percent thrive while millions
of others are struggling, earning less and losing
jobs; and

WHEREAS, a few lawmakers and out-
of-state corporate special interest groups see
the  current  economic  climate  as  an
opportunity to revive an old, outdated and
dangerous ideology known as Right to Work;
and

WHEREAS, 

these  out-of-state
corporate  special  interests  are  targeting
Missouri to lower wages and cut benefits for
middle class families so they can increase
corporate profits even more; and

WHEREAS, a handful of Missouri’s
elected officials have introduced Right to Work
legislation in the state Capitol, with the hopes

March 11, 2014

    The City Journal

             13

of turning Missouri into a Right to Work state;
and

WHEREAS, so-called Right to Work
legislation results in a race to the bottom and
has been proven to be a failed idea -creating
lower  wages,  an  unskilled  labor  force,
diminished pensions and health coverage, lost
jobs,  higher  poverty  rates  and  decreased
spending on education; and

WHEREAS, enacting laws to lower
wages and benefits for all workers in order to
lure low-paying jobs to the state is not a sound
economic plan for Missouri, and in particular
the City of St. Louis; and

WHEREAS, the total economic loss if
Missouri becomes a Right to Work state would
be devastating; and

WHEREAS, government, companies,
employees  and  labor  unions  should  be
working together to create good jobs and safe
work places and the proposed Right to Work
legislation does not meet that end; and

WHEREAS, unnecessary Right to Work
legislation is a distraction to the real issues
facing our great city and our great state;
NOW  THEREFORE  BE 

IT
RESOLVED by the Board of Aldermen of
the City of St. Louis that we oppose so-called
“Right to Work” proposals that would harm
Missouri’s  families  and  threaten  the
livelihoods  of  working  men  and  women
throughout the City of St. Louis and the state
of Missouri.

employees, chief officer, and managers of the
business regularly work and conduct business,

required for the furnishing of the goods or
performance of the services provided to the
City, as required by the contract, are physically
located in the City of St. Louis for at least one
taxable year immediately prior to the date of
the bid.

C. Bids may be for one or more or all the
articles advertised for, but there shall be a
specific bid on each article. The award may be
made to the lowest bidder for any article, or
to the lowest bidder for the entire requisition
or  any  part  thereof,  but  the  Board  of
Standardization may reject any or all bids or
any part of any bid.
