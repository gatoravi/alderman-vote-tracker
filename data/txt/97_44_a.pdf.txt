Resolution No. 186
Wade Funeral Home
100 Year Anniversary

WHEREAS, the Wade Funeral Home
was founded in 1914 by Walter Wade, at a
time when there was only three existing funeral
homes that would serve African American
Families; and

WHEREAS, the ambitious Wade wanted
to give superior care and service to all families
which was a ground breaking concept in 1914;
and

WHEREAS,  with  the  help  of  his
dedicated wife Mary, Walter Wade made Wade
Funeral Home the kind of funeral home he
dreamed of and they were known for their
tireless work ethics and overwhelming warmth;
and

WHEREAS, Walter Wade’s untimely
passing  was  a  tremendous  loss  to  the
community however, the funeral home and
Wade’s  tradition  lived  on  as  Mary
courageously ran the home alone; and

WHEREAS,  the  Wade’s  never  had
children and in the early 1940s Walter Wade’s
nephew Gilbert Wade Grandberry, returned
from the Navy and approached his aunt with
a request to purchase the funeral home which
she granted the request; and

WHEREAS, the first location of the
Wade Funeral Home was on Finney in the
City of St. Louis and Mr. G as the nephew
was  known  opened  a  second  location  for
Wade Funeral Home in Kinloch, MO and then
later acquired a third location at 4828 Natural
Bridge in the City of St. Louis in the 20th
Ward in the mid 1970’s and for a short time all
three locations were open for business; and
WHEREAS,  Mr.  Grandberry  later
decided to keep the business in a single location
at 4828 Natural Bridge and expand it as the
business grew, acquiring the Wade Florist
building next door to the West of the funeral
home  in  the  1970s.  Then  in  1992  Mr.
Grandberry seized another opportunity by
purchasing and remodeling the 22,500 square
foot building to the east of Wade Funeral Home
known today as the Twin Chapel which he
named in honor of his twin sister Garnette;
and

WHEREAS,  Mr.  Grandberry  was
successful  in  training  many  of  today’s
successful funeral home owners who got their
start at Wade; and

WHEREAS, in 1999 Mr. Grandberry
sold his business to the Perpetual Inc. and
Mr.  Grandberry  was  named  President
Emeritus and helped through the transition;
and

WHEREAS, on August 8, 2002 Mr.
Grandberry transitioned to glory.  However,
if he were alive today it is believed that he
would be proud of the dedicated staff at Wade
where many of the staff who worked for him
still cary out his mission of offering superior
service to families at their time of need; and
WHEREAS, on June 17, 2014 Wade
Funeral Home and Florist was acquired by
the ownership team of Saint Louisan Randy
Sanderson and Melvin Bryant just in time to
celebrate the 100 Anniversary of Wade Funeral
Home; and

WHEREAS,  Randy  Sanderson  and
Melvin Bryant are committed to continuing
the great legacy started by Mr. Grandberry

Committee Substitute As Amended

An Ordinance repealing Section One,
part 86.040 of Ordinance 56716, pertaining
to the opening of bids, codified as Section
5.58.040 of the Revised Code of the City of
St. Louis, and enacting a new provision on the
same subject matter which allows a local bidder
to match the lowest bid when the lowest bid
is from a non-local bidder; enacting a new
provision  on  the  same  subject  matter;
containing severability clause.

WHEREAS, local businesses which seek
to enter into contracts with the City of St.
Louis are at a competitive disadvantage with
businesses from other areas because of the
higher administrative costs of doing business
in the City;

WHEREAS,  the  City  of  St.  Louis
desires to encourage businesses to remain in
the City and to relocate to the City;

WHEREAS,  by  enacting  a  local
preference law that allows a local firm to match
the  lowest  bid  when  its  bid  is  within  2%
percent of the lowest bid, the City hopes to
encourage and stimulate local business.

BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF

ST. LOUIS AS FOLLOWS:

SECTION  ONE.  Section  One,  part
86.040, Ordinance 56716 is hereby repealed.

5.58.040 - Opening of bids.
A. Proposals shall be opened at the time
and place fixed by the advertisement, in the
presence  of  such  bidders  as  desire  to  be
present, and shall be open to the inspection
of bidders.

B.  The  bids  shall  not  be  materially
modified or amended as to price, specification
or otherwise, nor substitutions placed thereon,
after opening except when the lowest bid is
from a non-local bidder. When the lowest bid
is from a non-local bidder, any local bidder
within two percent of the lowest bid may
match the lowest bid. If a local bidder matches
the lowest bid, then the Supply Commissioner
may select the bid from the local bidder. If
more  than  one  local  bidder  is  within  two
percent of the lowest bid, then only the lowest
local bidder may match the bid. In all other
circumstances, modification, supplementation
or amendment shall cause rejection of the bid.
For purposes of this chapter, local bidder
means  a  bidder  whose  principal  place  of
business is within the City of St. Louis, has
had a valid business license for at least one
year, and is current in payment of local taxes.
Principal place of business shall be defined as
the business’s physical office, plant, or site
where  a  majority  (51%)  of  the  full-time
employees, chief officer, and managers of the
business regularly work and conduct business,
or where the plant or office and equipment
required for the furnishing of the goods or
performance of the services provided to the
City, as required by the contract, are physically
located in the City of St. Louis for at least one
taxable year immediately prior to the date of
the bid.

C. Bids may be for one or more or all the
articles advertised for, but there shall be a
specific bid on each article. The award may be
made to the lowest bidder for any article, or
to the lowest bidder for the entire requisition
or  any  part  thereof,  but  the  Board  of
Standardization may reject any or all bids or
any part of any bid.

SECTION THREE. Severability.
The  provisions  of  this  section  are
severable. If any provision of this ordinance
is declared invalid, that invalidity shall not
affect other provisions of the ordinance which
can  be  given  effect  without  the  invalid
provision.
Approved: April 29, 2013

The right to reject any and all bids is
