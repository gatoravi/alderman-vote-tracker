Louis,  MO.  where  he  currently  serves  as
minister; and

WHEREAS,  Donald  has  been  the
minister of Muhammad Mosque #28 since
1984.  He has been a pillar of the community
for many years, giving back in numerous ways,
such as prison ministry, mentoring programs
for young people in the community, as well
as being a part of the Victim’s Support Group
in the 27th ward.  Donald recently received
his Insurance license through Primerica in
2013.  He has also been involved in several
other business ventures over the years with
multi-level network marketing and gifting
programs.  Donald won a trip to Costa Rica
for him and his wife due to high sales of 4Life
health  products.    He  is  also  certified  in
Community Emergency Response, National
Incident Management System, State Level
Emergency  Management  and  Community
Disaster. Donald is a member of the Unity
PAC (Unified Political Action Committee) and
is heavily involved in helping candidates get
elected  in  St.  Louis  County.    Donald  has
several friends in the Christian ministry and
visits  numerous  churches  for  speaking
engagements throughout the year.  Even with
all of his hard work, he is still able to spend
quality time with his family.  Donald goes on
family vacation most summers to Branson,
MO and has also been to Orlando, FL.  His
personality is very loving and he will always
help anyone in need.  However, he often times
does not bite his tongue, and is known for
telling it like it is. Donald is also a joke teller
and is quite hilarious to all who know him.
He is an excellent husband, father, neighbor,
brother, friend, colleague, teacher, mentor, and
minister.

to the opening of bids, codified as Section
5.58.040 of the Revised Code of the City of
