Clerk was instructed to read same.
Resolution No. 175
Animal House Fund

WHEREAS, Animal House Fund is an
independent,  nonprofit,  stray  cat  rescue
organization. They are dedicated to creating
and maintaining an environmentally friendly,
no-kill shelter and adoption center for the
homeless cats and kittens of St. Louis City;
and

WHEREAS, Animal House opened in
August of 2010, with the arrival of dozens of
cats and kittens from the city’s overcrowded
animal control facility. The mayor of St. Louis
had  shuttered  the  decrepit  animal  control
building just weeks earlier. Had it not been for
Animal House, those cats and kittens would
have had nowhere to go; and

WHEREAS, the Animal House staff
handles the adoptions as well as being a  part
of a team that responds to calls from St. Louis
residents  about  cats  in  need. The Animal
House shelter provides a safe environment
and  medical  care  for  the  abandoned  and
homeless cats; and

WHEREAS,  all  the  cats  at Animal
House come to the shelter from challenging
circumstances  that  include  neglect,

abandonment and illness. Despite their sad
histories,  they  are  each  provided  with
nutritious food, medical care, socialization,
individual attention, love and the very best
effort to find each a loving and forever home;
and

WHEREAS, the Animal House facility
is large, airy, inviting and to the delight of
their  residents,  exclusive  to  felines.  Most
days, there are at least 200 happy, healthy
cats and kittens in the building, waiting to be
adopted; and

WHEREAS, in 2013 Animal House has
successfully adopted nearly 100 cats to loving
families. They do so with limited staff and
resources. Their goal for 2014 is to provide
save, loving homes to all their cats and kittens.
As a no-kill facility they offer state of the art
care in an open environment to enhance the
lives of cats and kittens in the city of St. Louis.
“We  Believe”  improves  the  St.  Louis
Community by improving the relationship
between people and their pets.

FIRST READING OF

RESOLUTIONS

Mr. French introduced Resolution No.
174 and the Clerk was instructed to read same.

Resolution No. 174

WHEREAS, on October 26, 2013, an
article in the St. Louis Post-Dispatch outlined
serious concerns related to the wrongful arrests
of up to one hundred St. Louis citizens due to
“clerical mistakes, and sloppy” attention to
fingerprint reports; and

WHEREAS, according to the St. Louis
Post-Dispatch article and lawsuits filed by
alleged  victims,  these  fingerprint  reports
provided information that the citizen arrested
was the wrong person; and

WHEREAS, in response to The Post-
Dispatch’s claims of identifying 100 people
arrested in error over the past seven years,
who have collectively spent more than 2,000
days in jail, Eddie Roth, a senior aide to Mayor
Francis Slay, is quoted in the article saying, “I
worry about a lot of things. I don’t worry
about this.” ; and

WHEREAS, officials have stated it is
the fault of the individuals wrongfully arrested
because, if their name had not been in a criminal
justice database, the mistake could not have
been made.

WHEREAS, it is the responsibility of
the City of St. Louis and its law enforcement
officials to preserve the civil liberties of all
citizens, regardless of past infractions; and

WHEREAS,  there  are  numerous
concerns raised by these wrongful arrests, as
reported. These concerns include: failure to
verify  the  identity  of  the  people  arrested;
potentially  ignoring  protests  of  citizens
wrongfully arrested; failure to differentiate
between the people who gave false names and
the people whose names were being falsely
used as aliases; downplaying cases where
systematic failure caused wrongful arrests of
St. Louis citizens; and failure to correct errors
in records which caused repeated wrongful
arrests, leaving authorities unsure of who they

December 17, 2013

    The City Journal

             13

were holding or who committed which past
crimes; and

WHEREAS,  city  officials  have
questioned the accuracy of the newspaper’s
overall information; and

WHEREAS,  wrongful  arrests  have
negative consequences on the lives of the
citizens wrongfully arrested and erodes the
faith of citizens in our judicial system; and

WHEREAS, it is the duty of St. Louis
Board of Aldermen to work to assure that all
of our constituents have confidence that their
liberties and safety are justly protected.
NOW  THEREFORE  BE 

IT
RESOLVED by the Board of Alderman for
the City of St. Louis that we direct the Public
Safety Committee to convene hearings for the
purpose of examining and investigating the
events, conditions, circumstances and failures
that lead to the wrongful arrests of citizens of
the City of St. Louis.

City of St. Louis Enterprise Zone
WHEREAS, by Ordinance No. 62886
this St. Louis Board of Aldermen (the “Board”)
authorized the Mayor, on behalf of the City
of  St.  Louis  (the  “City”),  to  request  the
designation of a certain area of the City, as
more  fully  described  in  said  ordinance
approved  June  29,  1993  as  an  St.  Louis
Enterprise Zone (“EZ”) eligible for the tax
incentives  provided  in  Sections  135.100

through  135.255,  inclusive,  R.S.MO.  as
amended (the “Statute”); and

WHEREAS,  the  Statute  allows,  in
certain circumstances and subject to certain
conditions, the ad valorem taxes which would
otherwise be due on subsequent real estate
improvements made in EZ areas to be abated
up to 100% for a period not to exceed 25
years from the date the original EZ Area was
so designated; and

WHEREAS,  Ordinance  No.  62886
provides for a ten (10) year abatement of taxes
on real property in the EZ in accordance with
the requirements of Section 135.215 of the
Statute, as amended from time to time, subject
to certain terms and conditions; and

WHEREAS, on June 9, 2000 this Board
approved Resolution No. 17 authorizing that
the ad valorem taxes that would otherwise be
imposed on subsequent improvements made
to the property at 1541-45 S. Kingshighway
Blvd. owned and occupied by Zein Group

be fully abated for a period of ten (10) years;

issued a Certificate of Completion dated April
22, 2002; and

WHEREAS, approximately two years
after  the  issuance  of  the  Certificate  of
Completion,  the  Developer  expanded  the
initial Subsequent Improvements anticipating
that ten (10) years of abatement would also
be  granted  for  the  additional  Subsequent
Improvements; and

WHEREAS,  because  the  additional
Subsequent Improvements were constructed
on the same parcel as the initial Subsequent
Improvements, no additional abatement was
granted  for  the  additional  Subsequent
Improvements; and

WHEREAS, it has been determined that
by granting one additional year of abatement
for all the Subsequent Improvements on the
parcel,  the  Developer  will  be  justly
compensated for both the initial and additional
Subsequent  Improvements  made  to  the
property; and

WHEREAS, Section 135.215 of the

obtaining the opinions and suggestions of
residents of political subdivision in the area

of abatement to compensate the Developer
for  the  construction  of  an  additional
Subsequent  Improvement  completed
approximately two years after issuance by
the LCRA of the Certificate of Completion
for the initial Subsequent Improvements.
2.
For  purposes  of  calculating  the  tax
liability for the Subsequent Improvements,
any  increase  in  the  assessment  of  any
improvements, from the assessment in effect
for such improvements as of January 1, 2011,
shall be deemed attributable to the Subsequent
Improvements.
3.
In accordance with Section 135.215(1)
of the Statute, a copy of this resolution shall
