The 100th Anniversary
of St. John the Baptist

WHEREAS, John the Baptist Parish
was organized on December 30, 1913, with
the  appointment  of  Father  John  Peters  as
pastor. The first Mass celebrated in the parish
took  place  on  February  1,  1914  at  4626
Gravois. Shortly thereafter land was bought

on Delor and Adkins Streets and ground was
broken for a building later called Sodality Hall;
and

WHEREAS,  St.  John  the  Baptist
Elementary School opened in September with
the Sisters of the Most Precious Blood of
O’Fallon teaching in the classrooms in the hall.
The cornerstone for a combination of school
and church was laid in August 1914 and was
completed in November 1914. The sisters
lived in the rear of the building while Father
Peters lived in Sodality Hall. In 1916, the
parish purchased six lots on Adkins Street
and Father Peters personally bought a house
as a rectory. A second floor was added to
Sodality Hall in 1917, as more classrooms were
needed. An addition was made to the sisters’
residence. The parish purchased Father Peters’
house in 1924 and it was used as the rectory
until 1957; and

WHEREAS,  a  new  building  was
constructed south of the church in 1922 and
this was the beginning of St. John the Baptist
High School. By 1930, the school was a four
year  accredited  parish  High  School.  The
present  church  was  started  in  1924  and
completed in 1930 with the erection of the
bell tower. The old church was then converted
in  to  classrooms  and  more  rooms  for  the
sisters. Within a period of 16 years, the parish
had built five buildings, including adding to
many of them, established and supported an
elementary school and high school and acquired
land for further expansion; and

WHEREAS, during the next 16 years
the high school program expanded and eight
more classrooms were added in 1934. In 1938,
the gym, cafeteria and four more classrooms
were added. In 1946, another wing was added
to  the  house,  the  library,  and  additional
classrooms as well. In 1957, a new Rectory
was built and an addition was added to the
convent in 1959. The elementary school was
becoming outdated and a new building was
started in 1963 and completed in 1964; and
WHEREAS, in 2005, Resurrection of
Our  Lord  Parish  and  Holy  Family  Parish
merged to become what today is the Parish
family of St. John the Baptist. The original
shrine from Holy Family Parish was installed
in the back of church in 2005; and

WHEREAS, in 2007, the inside of the
church  underwent  major  renovation  and
restoration.  In 2008, St. John the Baptist
High School closed its doors officially. The
Perpetual Help shrine was installed in the
Summer of 2008 as well.  In Fall 2009, St.
John the Baptist Elementary and Pre-School

while Officer Henderson has 8 years with the

misdemeanor, and 57 city ordinance violations;
and

WHEREAS,  Their  exceptional
performance, going above and beyond the call
of duty, did not go unnoticed.  Their hard
work and dedication is recognized by those
they work with, as well as the citizens of the
Fifth District; and

WHEREAS,  although  these  officers
perform  their  duties  with  exceptional
consistency, they remain motivated to go the
extra mile; and

WHEREAS,  during  the  month  of
December, Officer Henderson was on patrol
with another Fifth District officer, when they
observed  a  2001  Dodge  Neon  driving
erratically.  They activated their emergency
lights and attempted to stop the vehicle.  The
driver abandoned the vehicle and fled on foot.
Officer Henderson exited his police vehicle
and gave chase.  After a lengthy foot pursuit,
the driver was taken into custody.  The vehicle

was reported stolen the day before and the
juvenile suspect had a prior history of stealing
vehicles.   After  completing  the  necessary

Welfare of a Child” for her lack of parental
supervision; and

WHEREAS, in another incident during
the  month  of  May,  Officers  James  and
Henderson observed a large group of female
and male subjects arguing in the 2700 block of
Coleman.  A juvenile male then ran from the
scene and Officer James observed the juvenile
subject running while holding a silver handgun
in his hand.  After a short foot chase, the
juvenile  was  taken  into  custody  and  the
handgun was recovered.  A female subject was
located  who  made  a  written  statement
admitting to giving the handgun to the juvenile
and telling him to run.  She was arrested and
the juvenile was released into the custody of
his mother.  Charges were later issued against
the female by the Circuit Attorney’s Office;
and

WHEREAS, these two officers have
made a very positive impact on crime in the
Fifth District.  Their continuous efforts and
dedication have made the Fifth District a safer
place for all.  They have gained the admiration
of their peers and they are fine examples of
what younger officers should strive to be.

Resolution No. 224

Detective Sergeant Mark A. Sorocko
WHEREAS, Detective Sergeant Mark
A. Sorocko was nominated for the 5th District
Leadership Award due to his dedication and
commitment to excellence.  Detective Sergeant
Sorocko joined the St. Louis Metropolitan
Police Dept., in 1989 with his first assignment
being  the  Mobile  Reserve  Unit  where  he
learned the tactical fundamentals of becoming
an effective Police Officer; and

WHEREAS,  he  has  held  various
assignments to include Vice-Narcotics and
Crime Against Persons and various district
assignments to include the 3rd, 4th, and 5th
Districts.    It  was  his  start  in  the  Mobile
Reserve Unit that taught him the best practices
in  high  risk  car  stops  and  in  removing
dangerous weapons and gang members from
the community streets.  He has served the 5th
District in at least 3 different capacities; as a
Patrolman and as Detective Sergeant, and
often targeting trouble spots in the district
during his stints in Mobile Reserve and Crime
Against Persons; and

WHEREAS, Detective Sergeant Sorocko
does an exemplary job of managing the 5th
District Bureau Detectives, and providing
direction and guidance when needed, which
has resulted in several notable cases being
solved  due  to  his  team’s  involvement  i.e.
assaults, murders, (street and bank) robberies
and burglaries.  He welcomes the challenge of
assisting Detectives overcome their individual
struggles and become valued members of the
department; and

WHEREAS, although his talents are
many, utmost in his repertoire are his strong
investigative skills and his relentless nature in
lending assistance to neighboring districts/
units when needed.  Under his leadership,
several  high  profile  cases  were  solved:
Investigation into the (improper) disposal of
a human corpse led to a Murder 2nd Degree
charge being issued against a drug dealer for
his  role  in  the  death  of  a  College  Hill
Neighborhood resident.  In another case, in

2009, District Officers were fired upon by
fleeing robbery suspects, arresting one suspect
at that time.  In an unrelated investigation in
2013, his Detectives unearthed the identities
of two remaining suspects who were taken
into custody and charged accordingly.  These
are a few reasons why he is deserving of the
5th District Leadership Award for 2013.
NOW  THEREFORE  BE 

IT
RESOLVED by the Board of Aldermen of

during the justice movement of the 1960s and
70s, and

SECOND READING
OF RESOLUTIONS

Ms. Tyus  introduced  Resolution  No.
200 and the Clerk was instructed to read same.

Resolution No. 200

WHEREAS, This January 2014, The
City of St. Louis experienced some of the worst
cold weather and accumulated snowfall in
several decades; and

WHEREAS,  We  all  appreciate  the
dedicated hard work and long hours that the
employees of the City of St. Louis extended
attempting to remove the snow from our city
streets,  especially  the  Street  Department
employees of whom some worked 12 hour
shifts; and

WHEREAS,  Although  the  low
temperatures  and  large  amounts  of
accumulated snowfall is unusual for The City
of  St.  Louis,  it  is  not  unheard  of  or
unprecedented; and

WHEREAS,  Over the years, the City
of  St. Louis has experienced several separate
periods during the Winter Seasons (December
21- March 20) when there were large amounts
of snowfall; and

WHEREAS, Although the Executive
Branch of the City of St. Louis, specifically,
the Mayor’s Office appoints the Director of
Streets whose title is Street Commissioner and
who reports directly to the Mayor, the Street
Commissioner should also work with and keep
informed the  Legislative Branch in the City
of St. Louis  which is known as The Board of
Aldermen; and

WHEREAS, The Street Commissioner
should make sure that the City of St. Louis
has  a  snow  removal  plan  that  when
implemented would ensure that snow removal
in the City would be done in an orderly, timely
fair manner across the entire City of St. Louis
so that the residents and those doing business
with our fair city or just visiting could as soon
as possible return to their everyday activities
such as going to work, school, and church and
WHEREAS,  It  is  of  the  utmost
importance that this snow removal plan be in
writing and disseminated to the  Legislative
Branch of the City of St. Louis along with
other elected Officials and the general public
at large; and

WHEREAS, The current written Snow
Removal Policy of the City of St. Louis is to
pretreat the City’s Snow Routes with a brine
solution and once the snow begins to fall, the
plow/salt  trucks  are  to  make  their  rounds
treating and plowing as necessary.    Also, if
the forecast calls for several days of below-
freezing  temperatures  and  little  sunshine,
indicating snow will not be melting away
quickly,  crews  are  to  salt  residential
intersections to ensure safe stopping.; and

The City Journal

                                February 18, 2014

WHEREAS, Additionally, the written
snow removal policy goes on to state Plowing
Residential  streets  is  NOT    FEASIBLE
(emphasis  added)  as  the  streets  are  too
narrow, often tire ruts are already formed by
traffic preventing the City’s ability to push
the snow, and the difficulty plowing presents
for  residents  parked  on  the  street  getting
plowed in; and

WHEREAS, Lastly, the written snow
removal  policy  states  that  the  above
procedures are in place for all snow/ice events
in  the  City  of  St.  Louis  and  instructs  our
Citizens that is it is not necessary to call to
get their street treated and the above stated
snow removal policy  was repeated by  many
members  of  this  esteemed  Board  to  their
constituents in their respective wards when
the  constituents  called  regarding  snow
removal  on  their  streets  and  in  their
neighborhoods during this past snow storm;
and

WHEREAS, When the written Snow
Removal Plan for the City of St. Louis was
changed it was particularly important that not
only should the general public be advised but
also ALL MEMBERS of the Legislative Body
known  as  the  BOARD  OF ALDERMEN
should have been advised of said change so
that they may have properly informed their
many constituents to the changes in the plan
in connection with what the Executive Branch
and Street Commissioner were telling the
regarding the current snow removal policy for
the City ; and

WHEREAS, The residents and business
across the City of St. Louis pay taxes and
expect that they will all receive the same basic
City Service including snow removal in a
timely fair fashion in every neighborhood of
the City of St. Louis; and

WHEREAS, Throughout the City there
were  many  citizens  who  expressed
disappointment and dismay at the lack of snow
removal  in  their  neighborhoods  and
communities.  Many Citizens stating specific
reasons for their disappointment such as,  the
snow  routes  in  areas  where  they  lived  or
worked  were  not  properly  cleaned;  the
secondary streets were not  treated and plowed
or cleaned;  there was a lack of access to the
bus stops because the bus stops  because they
were  packed  with  snow;  residential
intersections  were  not  salted;  the  lack  of
timeliness  of  when  the  City  decided  they
would  plow  residential  streets,  and  the
apparent lack of a plan to address removing
the large amount of  snow; and

WHEREAS, It is the best interest of the

Citizens of St. Louis that we seek ways that
we as a City can improve upon our snow
removal and plan by  reexamine our written
policy,  especially  as  it  relates  to  large
accumulations of snowfall and cold weather,
by evaluating  our recent response to the snow,
and by seeking input from the Citizens of our
fair City as how we can better serve them in
the  removal  of  snow,  so  that  all  of  our
constituents  have  confidence  that  their
neighborhoods and communities are receiving
the same services and being treated fairly.

NOW  THEREFORE 

IT  BE
RESOLVED THAT THIS HONORABLE
BOARD OF ALDERMEN direct the Streets
Committee to convene hearing for the purpose
of examining and investigating the events, and
circumstances surrounding the recent snow
removal  program  and  to  further  gather
information  regarding  the  current  Snow
Removal Plan for the City of St. Louis, how
that plan can be improved, how we can better
implement the City’s Plan,  and how we can
better disseminate information and changes
to the plan to the members of the Board of
Aldermen, elected officials, as well as to ALL
residents, businesses, and visitors and the
general public at large.
