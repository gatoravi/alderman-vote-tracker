Msgr. Robert “Fr. Bob” Gettinger
WHEREAS, we have been apprised that
Msgr.  Robert  “Fr.  Bob”  Gettinger  will  be
recognized by the residents of the Twenty-
Second Ward  with  the  presentation  of  the
Good Neighbor Award; and

WHEREAS, Msgr. Robert “Fr. Bob”
Gettinger has been the pastor of St. Augustine
Parish since the merger of the former parishes
of Sts. Barbara, Rose of Lima, Edward, Mark
and Notre Dame De Lourdes in July 1992.
His prior North Deanery parish assignments
were Most Blessed Sacrament, Holy Name
and St. Bridget.  After his ordination in 1964,
Fr.  Bob’s  first  assignment  was  St.  Charles
Borromeo in St. Charles and later St. Sebastian
in the Northeast County; and

WHEREAS,  “Fr.  Bob”,  as  he  is
affectionately called, when reflecting on how
he got to where he is today, says it started
during  his  junior  class  retreat  at  Christian
Brothers College High School.  The priest
facilitating the retreat asked him to think about
becoming a priest.  Of course he responded
with a laugh saying “that would hurt my social
life.”  Fortunately, that was not his last thought
of the possibility and with the support of his
parents, he was ordained a priest; and

WHEREAS, throughout the years, he

14

The City Journal

                                       April 23, 2013

has become more involved with people from
every walk of life.  His passion to minister to
the poor and needy has blossomed over the
past 40 years.  When asked what has drawn
him to North St. Louis for more than 35 years,
he  says  “I  love  ministering  in  the African
American community.  Every Mass we offer
has  the  attitude  and  atmosphere  of  a
celebration”; and

WHEREAS,  there  is  never  a  missed
opportunity for him to bring the people he
meets closer to God.  A typical day consists
of helping people who are less fortunate.  He
doesn’t discriminate because of their religious
affiliation; and

WHEREAS,  on  average,  Fr.  Bob’s
charity assists up to 30 individuals three times
a week, matching their $25 with $50 towards
their rental, gas, electric or water bills.  Clients
can receive assistance once every 6 months.
Fr. Bob also gives funds to families in need of
funeral assistance, this ranges from $50 to
$100  given  directly  to  the  funeral  home
director.  There is also a Brightside program,
for those seeking a little spending money.  Fr.
Bob gives $5 to 5 - 8 men and women that
agree to clean up the streets surrounding the
church. 
  These  programs  provide
approximately  $8,000  a  week  in  overall
assistance.  Much of the funds that sponsor
his assistance programs come from private
donations.  “It’s just whoever will help me.”
His  biggest  project  is  the  Christmas  Food
Basket Program that he has coordinated since
1972, when he was associate pastor of the
former Most Holy Name.  Now, more than
3,500 baskets or shopping cards are handed
out each year, which costs over $115,000.
This again is a result of private donations; and
WHEREAS, other parts of his day may
consist of visiting the sick and homebound,
making a trip to the St. Augustine Wellston
Outreach Center, celebrating daily Mass in
the  rectory,  or  at  the  parish  school,  or
providing funds for energy/rental for those in
need every Monday, Wednesday and Friday;
and

WHEREAS,  over  the  years,  he  has
made  many  friends  and  has  never  met  a
stranger.  If you’ve met him once, he will make
a lasting impression upon you.

NOW  THEREFORE  BE 

IT
RESOLVED by the Board of Aldermen of
the City of St. Louis, that we pause in our
deliberations to recognize and congratulate
Msgr.  Robert  “Fr.  Bob”  Gettinger  and  we
