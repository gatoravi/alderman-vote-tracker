Ms. Tyus moved to suspend the rules
for the purpose of introducing Resolution No.
200.

Seconded by Mr. Schmid.
Carried unanimously by voice vote.

Resolution No. 200

WHEREAS, This January 2014, The
City of St. Louis experienced some of the worst
cold weather and accumulated snowfall in
several decades; and

WHEREAS,  We  all  appreciate  the
dedicated hard work and long hours that the
employees of the City of St. Louis extended
attempting to remove the snow from our city
streets,  especially  the  Street  Department
employees of whom some worked 12 hour
shifts; and

WHEREAS,  Although  the  low
temperatures  and  large  amounts  of
accumulated snowfall is unusual for The City
of  St.  Louis,  it  is  not  unheard  of  or
unprecedented; and

WHEREAS,  Over the years, the City
of  St. Louis has experienced several separate
periods during the Winter Seasons (December
21- March 20) when there were large amounts
of snowfall; and

WHEREAS, Although the Executive
Branch of the City of St. Louis, specifically,
the Mayor’s Office appoints the Director of
Streets whose title is Street Commissioner and
who reports directly to the Mayor, the Street
Commissioner should also work with and keep
informed the  Legislative Branch in the City
of St. Louis  which is known as The Board of
Aldermen; and

WHEREAS, The Street Commissioner
should make sure that the City of St. Louis
has  a  snow  removal  plan  that  when
implemented would ensure that snow removal
in the City would be done in an orderly, timely
fair manner across the entire City of St. Louis
so that the residents and those doing business
with our fair city or just visiting could as soon
as possible return to their everyday activities
such as going to work, school, and church and
WHEREAS,  It  is  of  the  utmost
importance that this snow removal plan be in
writing and disseminated to the  Legislative
Branch of the City of St. Louis along with
other elected Officials and the general public
at large; and

WHEREAS, The current written Snow
Removal Policy of the City of St. Louis is to
pretreat the City’s Snow Routes with a brine

solution and once the snow begins to fall, the
plow/salt  trucks  are  to  make  their  rounds
treating and plowing as necessary.    Also, if
the forecast calls for several days of below-
freezing  temperatures  and  little  sunshine,
indicating snow will not be melting away
quickly,  crews  are  to  salt  residential
intersections to ensure safe stopping.; and

WHEREAS, Additionally, the written
snow removal policy goes on to state Plowing
Residential  streets  is  NOT    FEASIBLE
(emphasis  added)  as  the  streets  are  too
narrow, often tire ruts are already formed by
traffic preventing the City’s ability to push
the snow, and the difficulty plowing presents
for  residents  parked  on  the  street  getting
plowed in; and

WHEREAS, Lastly, the written snow
removal  policy  states  that  the  above
procedures are in place for all snow/ice events
in  the  City  of  St.  Louis  and  instructs  our
Citizens that is it is not necessary to call to
get their street treated and the above stated
snow removal policy  was repeated by  many
members  of  this  esteemed  Board  to  their
constituents in their respective wards when
the  constituents  called  regarding  snow
removal  on  their  streets  and  in  their
neighborhoods during this past snow storm;
and

WHEREAS, When the written Snow
Removal Plan for the City of St. Louis was
changed it was particularly important that not
only should the general public be advised but
also ALL MEMBERS of the Legislative Body
known  as  the  BOARD  OF ALDERMEN
should have been advised of said change so
that they may have properly informed their
many constituents to the changes in the plan
in connection with what the Executive Branch
and Street Commissioner were telling the
regarding the current snow removal policy for
the City ; and

WHEREAS, The residents and business
across the City of St. Louis pay taxes and
expect that they will all receive the same basic
City Service including snow removal in a
timely fair fashion in every neighborhood of
the City of St. Louis; and

WHEREAS, Throughout the City there
were  many  citizens  who  expressed
disappointment and dismay at the lack of snow
removal  in  their  neighborhoods  and
communities.  Many Citizens stating specific
reasons for their disappointment such as,  the
snow  routes  in  areas  where  they  lived  or
worked  were  not  properly  cleaned;  the
secondary streets were not  treated and plowed
or cleaned;  there was a lack of access to the

bus stops because the bus stops  because they
were  packed  with  snow;  residential
intersections  were  not  salted;  the  lack  of
timeliness  of  when  the  City  decided  they
would  plow  residential  streets,  and  the
apparent lack of a plan to address removing
the large amount of  snow; and

WHEREAS, It is the best interest of the
Citizens of St. Louis that we seek ways that
we as a City can improve upon our snow
removal and plan by  reexamine our written
policy,  especially  as  it  relates  to  large
accumulations of snowfall and cold weather,
by evaluating  our recent response to the snow,
and by seeking input from the Citizens of our
fair City as how we can better serve them in
the  removal  of  snow,  so  that  all  of  our
constituents  have  confidence  that  their
neighborhoods and communities are receiving
the same services and being treated fairly.

NOW  THEREFORE 

IT  BE
RESOLVED THAT THIS HONORABLE
BOARD OF ALDERMEN direct the Streets
Committee to convene hearing for the purpose
of examining and investigating the events, and
circumstances surrounding the recent snow
removal  program  and  to  further  gather
information  regarding  the  current  Snow
Removal Plan for the City of St. Louis, how
that plan can be improved, how we can better
implement the City’s Plan,  and how we can
better disseminate information and changes
to the plan to the members of the Board of
Aldermen, elected officials, as well as to ALL
residents, businesses, and visitors and the
general public at large.

to the opening of bids, codified as Section
5.58.040 of the Revised Code of the City of

to match the lowest bid when the lowest bid
is from a non-local bidder; enacting a new
provision  on  the  same  subject  matter;
containing severability clause.

businesses from other areas because of the
higher administrative costs of doing business
in the City;

WHEREAS,  the  City  of  St.  Louis
desires to encourage businesses to remain in
the City and to relocate to the City;

WHEREAS,  by  enacting  a  local
preference law that allows a local firm to match

BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF

ST. LOUIS AS FOLLOWS:

SECTION  ONE.  Section  One,  part

of bidders.

B.  The  bids  shall  not  be  materially
modified or amended as to price, specification
or otherwise, nor substitutions placed thereon,
after opening except when the lowest bid is
from a non-local bidder. When the lowest bid
is from a non-local bidder, any local bidder
within two percent of the lowest bid may
match the lowest bid. If a local bidder matches
the lowest bid, then the Supply Commissioner
may select the bid from the local bidder. If
more  than  one  local  bidder  is  within  two
percent of the lowest bid, then only the lowest
local bidder may match the bid. In all other
circumstances, modification, supplementation
or amendment shall cause rejection of the bid.
For purposes of this chapter, local bidder
means  a  bidder  whose  principal  place  of
business is within the City of St. Louis, has
had a valid business license for at least one
year, and is current in payment of local taxes.
Principal place of business shall be defined as
the business’s physical office, plant, or site
where  a  majority  (51%)  of  the  full-time
employees, chief officer, and managers of the
business regularly work and conduct business,
or where the plant or office and equipment
required for the furnishing of the goods or
performance of the services provided to the
City, as required by the contract, are physically
located in the City of St. Louis for at least one
taxable year immediately prior to the date of
the bid.

C. Bids may be for one or more or all the
articles advertised for, but there shall be a
specific bid on each article. The award may be
made to the lowest bidder for any article, or
to the lowest bidder for the entire requisition
or  any  part  thereof,  but  the  Board  of
Standardization may reject any or all bids or
any part of any bid.

SECTION THREE. Severability.
The  provisions  of  this  section  are
severable. If any provision of this ordinance
is declared invalid, that invalidity shall not
affect other provisions of the ordinance which
can  be  given  effect  without  the  invalid
provision.
