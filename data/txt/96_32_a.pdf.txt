No.  139  through  140  and  the  Clerk  was
instructed to read same.

Resolution No. 139

Mother Geneva Gentry

WHEREAS, Mother Geneva Gentry
was born on May 12, 1912 in Waynesboro,
Mississippi. She was the only child born to
the  late  Daisy  (Robinson)  Dent.    Mother
Gentry dedicated her life to the Lord at an
early age. She moved to St. Louis with her
mother at the age of nine. She was one of the
first students to attend the Vashon High School
at its original location on Laclede Avenue.
Mother Gentry married the late Joshua Gentry
in 1942.  To this union two children were
born, Lt. Col. (Ret.) Joseph Gentry and Dr.
Marabeth Gentry.  After 48 years of marriage,
the  Lord  called  Brother  Gentry  home  on
March 27, 1990; and

WHEREAS, at the age of 14, after an
invitation from Reverend Pa Allen, she joined
Christ’s Southern Mission Baptist Church
under  the  Pastorate  of  the  late  Reverend
Herman Gore, Sr. Mother Gentry had great
love and respect for the late Reverend Herman
Gore, Jr. and her current pastor, the Reverend
Lamarr  Goldman. At  Christ’s  Southern
Mission, she served as President of the Willing
Workers Ministry for over 60 years, member
of the Mother’s Board, sponsor of the Mother
Gore’s  Mission  (MGM)  Ministry,  Mother
of the Adult Choir and served on the Board of
the  Mother  Gore  Scholarship  Committee.
Under Reverend Gore’s leadership, she became

which was an evangelistic singing ministry;
and

WHEREAS, in 1939, Mother Gentry
became active in the National Convention of
Gospel Choirs and Choruses, Inc. (NCGCC)

which was founded by the late Dr. Thomas A.
Dorsey.  It  was  at  the  Dorsey  Convention
where Mother Gentry was introduced by the
late Madam Fannie Foster to the handsome
and illustrious Joshua Gentry, the love of her
life. Mother Gentry loved young people; it
was out of this love that following the death
of Brother Gentry, she started a scholarship
fund at the NCGCC in his name to aid young
people in reaching their educational goals.
Mother  Gentry  served  as  the  National
Consecration Coordinator for the convention.
She was the oldest living member and beloved
Mother of the convention. As the Lord would
have it, Mother Gentry along with her spiritual
son, the late Bishop Kenneth H. Moales, Sr.
attended  their  last  convention  together  in
Orlando, Florida in August of 2010. In 1943,
Mother Gentry and her husband organized
“When Singers Meet, Inc.” a gospel music
extravaganza. This annual event, held on the
first Sunday in March, spotlights local and
national gospel artists; and

WHEREAS, in the community, Mother
Gentry was a Charter Member and Chaplain
in the 1960s and 70s of the Yeatman District
Community Corporation and helped organize
the Yeatman Parent-Child Center. This center
served families and unwed mothers (which
she had a fond love for).  She served as Co-
Chairman of the Women’s Division of the Billy
Graham Crusade in 1973. She also gave service
to the Salvation Army’s Harbor Light Mission
which began in 1967. Mother Gentry was a
member and volunteer worker for the Home
Mission and Evangelistic Board of the National
Baptist Convention, USA, Inc. She was a
Lifetime Member of the Board of Volunteers
of  the  Metropolitan  Psychiatric  Center
(formally known as Malcolm-Bliss). She also
worked for many years with the late Reverend
Joseph D. Linton and the Progressive Baptist
Church in their Food for the Hungry Outreach
Program; and

WHEREAS, Mother Gentry received
numerous awards for her work, some of which
included: Gospel Historian Music Award, Dr.
Martin Luther King Pioneer Award, Gospel
Pioneer Award presented by the Announcers
Guild  of  the  Gospel  Music Workshop  of
America, a Lifetime Certificate of Membership
to the Gospel Music Workshop of America
presented to her by Founder, the late Reverend
James Cleveland, 50 Year Service Award from
the National Convention of Gospel Choirs
and  Choruses,  Washington  University
Continuing Education Award, the Clarence

Love”  in  which  she  shared  kind  smiles,
encouraging words, a listening ear and spiritual
guidance to many in the St. Louis metropolitan
area as well as across the length and breadth
of  this  country.    This  “Legacy  of  Love”
continues through her son, Lt. Col. (Ret.)
Joseph Gentry and her daughter, Dr. Marabeth
Gentry;  two  granddaughters,  Stephanie
Gentry and Janeen (Duane) Gentry-Bowen;
four  great-grandchildren;  two  great-great
grandchildren and a host of cousins, spiritual
children,  her  Christ’s  Southern  Mission
family, her NCGCC family and many friends.
  NOW  THEREFORE  BE  IT
RESOLVED by the Board of Aldermen of
the  City  of  St.  Louis  that  we  pause  to
remember the many contributions of Mother
Geneva Gentry to the citizens of the City of
St. Louis and we join with her many friends in
