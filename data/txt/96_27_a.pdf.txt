Resolution No. 92

Wanda Whitlock-Kincade
WHEREAS, Wanda Whitlock-Kincade
was born on January 11, 1950 in St. Louis to
Hughes and Geneva Carter.  To this union
there were 9 children born; and

WHEREAS, Wanda was educated in the
St. Louis Public School System and graduated
from Charles Sumner High School.  Wanda
loved to learn and was dedicated to pushing
the importance of education.  She was the
first in the family to receive a Master’s Degree.
She attended Lindenwood University; and

WHEREAS, Wanda was a woman of
many talents and very versatile and whatever
she put her hands to prospered, she shared
and utilized her gifts with everyone.  She was
a pillar in the community, demanded respect
and taught life lessons as they were presented.
Wanda was employed as an accountant for
the federal government.  Her federal work
career  had  been  devoted  to  serving  the
Department of Defense.  She also worked in
the Department of Finance and Accounting,
and  retired  after  22  years  due  to  health
complications; and

WHEREAS,  after  several  bouts  of
illness, she was called home to glory April 25,
2013 at 8:15 am.  She fought a good fight and
kept the faith, now she’s gone on to the next
phase in this spiritual journey.  She already
accomplished all of her earthly deeds and was
ready to breathe with ease; and

WHEREAS, Wanda confessed her faith
in  Christ  and  was  baptized  early  in  her
childhood  at Antioch  Baptist  Church.
Growing in her spiritual walk, she yoked up
with “Big Thunda” and became an active
member  of  the  Mt.  Pleasant  Missionary
Baptist Church.  She got busy working on the
Pastor’s Aid and other auxiliaries until she was
called home; and

WHEREAS, Wanda was admired by so
many  for  the  humanitarian  qualities  she
possessed and shared with everyone.  She was
truly the epitome of the old adage “Let the
Good that I Do Speak for Me!”  She loved life
and lived it to the fullest.  Always reminding
herself  and  others  “Without  Faith,  it  is
impossible to please God” and she aimed to
please God!  Wanda was a treasure to know.
If you met her, you were far from being a
stranger and if you saw her you were greeted
with a smile and the TRUTH, where you
wanted it or not.  The world lost a legacy of
love with Wanda’s Exodus.  However her home
going is truly a Heaven gain; and

WHEREAS, Wanda was preceded in

death by both her parents, Hughes and Geneva
Carter, by her three brothers: her twin-Wildord
Carter, John Willis and Eugene Wiley; and

world, he served as Senior Vice President of
Sales and Marketing for Blue Cross Blue

prophetic experience of being saved in the
same revival service.  They are the blessed
parents of Sean, Craig, and Courtney and
proud grandparents of Kyng Cleveland, Paige
Bass and Hannah Bass.  Ten years ago they
lost their eldest son, Sean Edwin, through a
random and heinous act of violence.  From the

tremendous insight and empathy into the hurts
and  wounds  of  others,  and  have  thereby
enlarged their capacity for ministry; and

WHEREAS, Bishop Bass is especially
energized  by  the  opportunity  to  serve  as
President of COGIC Urban Initiatives because

God through the Church that he has cherished
and  participated  in  for  a  lifetime.    In  his
words, “This is an opportunity to bring a
lifetime of learning and experience to bear on
behalf of the Church I love and under the
direction of an awesome, visionary leader,
Bishop Charles Edward Blake, Sr.”; and

WHEREAS, those who know Bishop
Bass well can attest to his intellectual and
leadership competencies, but they are more
profoundly impressed by his deep sense of
loyalty, integrity, humility and fervor for the
things of God.

NOW  THEREFORE  BE
