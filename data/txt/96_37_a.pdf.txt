Resolution No. 171

Mary Jean Cox Pearson
WHEREAS,  we  pause  in  our
deliberations to note the passing of St. Louis
resident, Mary Jean Cox Pearson; and

WHEREAS, Mary Jean Cox Pearson,
beloved First Lady of the Newstead Avenue
Baptist Church, wife, mother, and teacher,
was born on March 1, 1943, in Humboldt,
Tennessee. She was the thirteenth of seventeen
children born to Willie and Lizzie Cox.  Sister
Pearson, as she was affectionately called,
professed her love of Christ early in life and
never wavered in her faith; and

WHEREAS,  in  spite  of  the  limited
opportunities for African Americans in the
South in the fifties and sixties, Mrs. Pearson
graduated from Lane College with a degree in
teaching in 1969.  It was during this time that
she met Richard L. Pearson, Sr., an army
veteran and college student.  Mr. Pearson knew
at first glance that the pretty young woman
with long hair and a cute walk would one day
be his wife. The couple married on June 21,
1970, and moved to St. Louis to start their
careers. Pastor Pearson, who was not yet a
“church-goer,”  soon  realized  that  Sister
Pearson was a committed Christian with super
strong faith in God.  “It didn’t matter what
great plans I had on Sunday, such as going to
see a sports event; she would always direct
me to drop her off at church,” recalls Pastor
Pearson. He eventually decided to see what it
was that arrested her attention every Sunday.
Mrs. Pearson’s character and strength caused
him to start attending church each Sunday,
ultimately becoming a preacher and pastor, as
well as giving up vices such as alcohol and
cigarettes.    The  couple,  blessed  with  two
children, Yolanda (Buford) Hawthorne and
Richard (Alicia) Jr., remained partners in life
for 43 years; and

WHEREAS, Mary Jean Pearson was a
dedicated  elementary  school  teacher  who
began her career at Dunbar Elementary School
in the Kinloch School District.  She became
one of the first African Americans selected to
integrate the Parker Road Elementary School
in the Ferguson - Florissant School District.
She  would  go  on  to  teach  at Airport  and
Bermuda elementary schools.  She served her
students with devotion, integrity and love.
“She was an excellent teacher who did not
accept foolishness in her classroom. However,
she was equally caring; her spirit was very
Christ-like. I always knew she cared about
my future,” remarked a former student.  Mrs.
Pearson,  who  worked  under 
three
superintendents, including Dr. John Wright,
retired after 32 years of service; and

WHEREAS, First Lady Pearson was a
devoted member of the Newstead Avenue
Missionary Baptist Church, serving in several
ministries.  In addition to being First Lady,
she was known for her lovely soprano voice,
and was one of the lead soloists in the music
ministry.  She taught in the Sunday School
and Vacation Bible School ministries and was

Aldermen, since its inception, has relied on
the  insightful  contributions  and  expert
knowledge of citizens throughout the St. Louis
community; and

people, by the people and for the people -

of our society and the effective administration
of its government; and

WHEREAS, JoAnn Williams has been
a fixture at St. Louis City Hall for more than
20 years; and

on a long and winding road through the inner
workings of state of local government and we

her service to this great city; and

Louis through her work with the St. Louis
Housing Authority, the Employee Retirement
System and the countless committees, boards,
panels, commissions and working groups she
has generously volunteered to spearhead; and
WHEREAS,  her  most  admirable
contribution and lasting legacy is the tireless
voice she has given to the hard-working men
and women - the City employees - who, with
little fanfare, cut the grass, staff the jails, clean
the parks, inspect the buildings, maintain the
airport, provide security and house the city’s
stray animals, and

WHEREAS, her institutional knowledge
of city government has, at times, eclipsed that
of even our elected officials; and

and wit will be sorely missed by all of us who
have come to know and respect her.

NOW  THEREFORE  BE 

IT
RESOLVED BY THE BOARD of Aldermen

Liberator Bombers.  Such missions required

Air  Force  as  a  Lieutenant  Colonel  after
twenty-seven years of service; and

WHEREAS, following his retirement,
Colonel Lane served as the Executive Director
of  Greater  Omaha  Community Action
(“G.O.C.A”).    Over  the  next  twenty-two
years, he provided much needed services to
the youth, disabled, and elderly.  He also
developed and managed programs dedicated
to addressing the issues of poverty, alcoholism,
homelessness, and mental health; and

WHEREAS, Colonel Lane was an active
member of the Alphonza W. Davis Chapter
of the Tuskegee Airmen, Inc.  He was also a
lifetime member of the Tuskegee Airmen, Inc.,
and  served  on  the  organization’s  national
board.  Colonel Lane enjoyed sharing his
experiences as an original Tuskagee Airman
with the community, and educating others
about  the  historical  contributions  of  the
Tuskegee Airmen, otherwise known as “World
War II’s best kept secret.” ; and

WHEREAS,  in  1990,  Colonel  Lane
founded the 99th Pursuit Cadet Squadron of
the Nebraska Wing of the Civil air Patrol, the
official auxiliary of the United States Air Force.
As the Squadron’s first Commander, and later
its  Commander  Emeritus,  he  mentored
countless  youth  and  promoted  aviation
throughout Nebraska; and

WHEREAS,  Colonel  Lane  was  the
recipient  of  numerous  awards  and
acknowledgments.  In 2003, he was inducted
into the Nebraska Aviation Hall of Fame.  In
2006, he received an Honorary Doctor in
Public Service from the Tuskegee University.
In 2007, President George W. Bush presented
Colonel  Lane  with  a  Congressional  Gold
Medal.  However, he considered his family to
be his most important accomplishment; and

of  St.  Louis  (the  “City”),  to  request  the
designation of a certain area of the City, as
more  fully  described  in  said  ordinance
approved  June  29,  1993  as  an  St.  Louis
Enterprise Zone (“EZ”) eligible for the tax

amended (the “Statute”); and

WHEREAS,  the  Statute  allows,  in
certain circumstances and subject to certain
conditions, the ad valorem taxes which would

up to 100% for a period not to exceed 25
years from the date the original EZ Area was
so designated; and

WHEREAS,  Ordinance  No.  62886

Completion,  the  Developer  expanded  the
initial Subsequent Improvements anticipating
that ten (10) years of abatement would also

shall be deemed attributable to the
Subsequent Improvements.

to the opening of bids, codified as Section
5.58.040 of the Revised Code of the City of

same subject matter which allows a local bidder
to match the lowest bid when the lowest bid
is from a non-local bidder; enacting a new
provision  on  the  same  subject  matter;
containing severability clause.

businesses from other areas because of the
higher administrative costs of doing business
in the City;

WHEREAS,  the  City  of  St.  Louis
desires to encourage businesses to remain in

WHEREAS,  by  enacting  a  local
preference law that allows a local firm to match

encourage and stimulate local business.

BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF

ST. LOUIS AS FOLLOWS:

SECTION  ONE.  Section  One,  part
86.040, Ordinance 56716 is hereby repealed.
SECTION  TWO.  Enacted  in  lieu

thereof is the following new section.

5.58.040 - Opening of bids.
A. Proposals shall be opened at the time
and place fixed by the advertisement, in the
presence  of  such  bidders  as  desire  to  be
present, and shall be open to the inspection
of bidders.

B.  The  bids  shall  not  be  materially
modified or amended as to price, specification
or otherwise, nor substitutions placed thereon,
after opening except when the lowest bid is
from a non-local bidder. When the lowest bid
is from a non-local bidder, any local bidder
within two percent of the lowest bid may
match the lowest bid. If a local bidder matches
the lowest bid, then the Supply Commissioner
may select the bid from the local bidder. If
more  than  one  local  bidder  is  within  two
percent of the lowest bid, then only the lowest
local bidder may match the bid. In all other
circumstances, modification, supplementation
or amendment shall cause rejection of the bid.
For purposes of this chapter, local bidder
means  a  bidder  whose  principal  place  of
business is within the City of St. Louis, has
had a valid business license for at least one
year, and is current in payment of local taxes.
Principal place of business shall be defined as
the business’s physical office, plant, or site
where  a  majority  (51%)  of  the  full-time
employees, chief officer, and managers of the
business regularly work and conduct business,
or where the plant or office and equipment
required for the furnishing of the goods or
performance of the services provided to the
City, as required by the contract, are physically
located in the City of St. Louis for at least one
taxable year immediately prior to the date of
the bid.

C. Bids may be for one or more or all the
articles advertised for, but there shall be a
specific bid on each article. The award may be
made to the lowest bidder for any article, or
to the lowest bidder for the entire requisition
or  any  part  thereof,  but  the  Board  of
Standardization may reject any or all bids or
any part of any bid.

SECTION THREE. Severability.
The  provisions  of  this  section  are
severable. If any provision of this ordinance
is declared invalid, that invalidity shall not
affect other provisions of the ordinance which
can  be  given  effect  without  the  invalid
provision.
Approved: April 29, 2013
