Resolution No. 17

Alvin Ailey

American Dance Theater
WHEREAS, Alvin Ailey American
Dance  Theater  grew  from  a  now-fabled
performance in March 1958 at the 92nd Street
Y in New York City. Led by Alvin Ailey and
a group of young African-American modern
dancers, that performance changed forever the
perception of American dance; and

WHEREAS, the Ailey company has
gone on to perform for an estimated 25 million
people at theaters in 48 states and 71 countries
on six continents — as well as millions more
through television broadcasts; and

in  2008,  a  U.S.
Congressional  resolution  designated  the
Company  as  “a  vital American  cultural
ambassador to the world” that celebrates the
uniqueness of the African-American cultural
experience  and  the  preservation  and
enrichment of the American modern dance
heritage; and

WHEREAS,  when  Mr. Ailey  began
creating dances, he drew upon his “blood
memories” of Texas, the blues, spirituals, and
gospel as inspiration, which resulted in the
creation of his most popular and critically
acclaimed work, Revelations. Although he
created 79 ballets over his lifetime, Mr. Ailey
maintained  that  his  company  was  not
exclusively a repository for his own work;
and

WHEREAS,  today,  the  Company
continues Mr. Ailey’s mission by presenting
important  works  of 
the  past  and
commissioning new ones. In all, more than
235 works by over 90 choreographers have
been part of the Ailey company’s repertory.
Before his untimely death in 1989, Alvin Ailey
named Judith Jamison as his successor, and
over  the  next  21  years,  she  brought  the
Company  to  unprecedented  success.  Ms.
Jamison, in turn, personally selected Robert
Battle to succeed her in 2011, and The New
York Times declared he “has injected the
company with new life”; and

ORDINANCE #69431
Board Bill No. 295

Committee Substitute As Amended

An Ordinance repealing Section One,
part 86.040 of Ordinance 56716, pertaining
to the opening of bids, codified as Section
5.58.040 of the Revised Code of the City of
St. Louis, and enacting a new provision on the
same subject matter which allows a local bidder
to match the lowest bid when the lowest bid
is from a non-local bidder; enacting a new
provision  on  the  same  subject  matter;
containing severability clause.

WHEREAS, local businesses which seek
to enter into contracts with the City of St.
Louis are at a competitive disadvantage with
businesses from other areas because of the
higher administrative costs of doing business
in the City;

WHEREAS,  the  City  of  St.  Louis
desires to encourage businesses to remain in
the City and to relocate to the City;

WHEREAS,  by  enacting  a  local
preference law that allows a local firm to match
the  lowest  bid  when  its  bid  is  within  2%
percent of the lowest bid, the City hopes to
encourage and stimulate local business.

BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF

ST. LOUIS AS FOLLOWS:

SECTION  ONE.  Section  One,  part
86.040, Ordinance 56716 is hereby repealed.
SECTION  TWO.  Enacted  in  lieu

thereof is the following new section.

5.58.040 - Opening of bids.
A. Proposals shall be opened at the time
and place fixed by the advertisement, in the
presence  of  such  bidders  as  desire  to  be
present, and shall be open to the inspection
of bidders.

B.  The  bids  shall  not  be  materially
modified or amended as to price, specification
or otherwise, nor substitutions placed thereon,
after opening except when the lowest bid is
from a non-local bidder. When the lowest bid
is from a non-local bidder, any local bidder
within two percent of the lowest bid may
match the lowest bid. If a local bidder matches
the lowest bid, then the Supply Commissioner
may select the bid from the local bidder. If
more  than  one  local  bidder  is  within  two
percent of the lowest bid, then only the lowest
local bidder may match the bid. In all other
circumstances, modification, supplementation
or amendment shall cause rejection of the bid.
For purposes of this chapter, local bidder
means  a  bidder  whose  principal  place  of
business is within the City of St. Louis, has
had a valid business license for at least one
year, and is current in payment of local taxes.
Principal place of business shall be defined as
the business’s physical office, plant, or site
where  a  majority  (51%)  of  the  full-time
employees, chief officer, and managers of the
business regularly work and conduct business,
or where the plant or office and equipment
required for the furnishing of the goods or
performance of the services provided to the
City, as required by the contract, are physically
located in the City of St. Louis for at least one
taxable year immediately prior to the date of
the bid.

C. Bids may be for one or more or all the
articles advertised for, but there shall be a
specific bid on each article. The award may be
made to the lowest bidder for any article, or
to the lowest bidder for the entire requisition
or  any  part  thereof,  but  the  Board  of
Standardization may reject any or all bids or
any part of any bid.

SECTION THREE. Severability.
The  provisions  of  this  section  are
severable. If any provision of this ordinance
is declared invalid, that invalidity shall not
affect other provisions of the ordinance which
can  be  given  effect  without  the  invalid
provision.
Approved: April 29, 2013

The right to reject any and all bids is

reserved
