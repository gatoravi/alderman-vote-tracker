COURTESY RESOLUTIONS

CONSENT CALENDAR

 President Reed introduced Resolutions
No. 86 through 93 and the Clerk was instructed
to read same.

Resolution No. 86

Lotus Avenue

Block Party Reunion

WHEREAS, On September 21, 2013,
the triple block of Lotus Avenue (5000-5200)
in the Kingsway West Neighborhood of North
St. Louis, celebrated its first “United Block
Party” and the original idea and planning for
this event came from five men who lived on
the blocks; and

July 8, 2014

    The City Journal

          9

WHEREAS,  These  men  not  only
planned  this  block  party,  but  they  also
prepared and cooked all the ribs, hamburgers,
hot dogs, fried chicken, and fish as well as
recruited other block residents to provide side
dishes to go along with the prepared meats;
and

WHEREAS, In addition to the cooking
and recruiting of others to provide side dishes,
they  also  made  contact  with  out-of  town
family members and friends who grew up on
the block to request their attendance to this
great celebration. Much to their surprise, the
response was phenomenal and the block party
morphed into a beautiful, heart-warming, tear-
filled family reunion; and

WHEREAS, The children played on a
huge bounce house and were served snow cones
and cotton candy treats which was a big hit
with everyone.  Horses trotted down the block
for our children’s entertainment, and every
young person received a bag of treats.  A D.J.
was hired for music entertainment.  Special
honors were given to the oldest person living
on the block, and to the first African American
family that moved onto the block in 1951 and
the men pulled off one of the best “United
Block Parties” in the history of St. Louis; and
WHEREAS,  The  team  of  men
understood  the  importance  of  and  were
committed  to  community  unity.  That
commitment continued through the 2013-2014
fall and winter seasons. While continuing this
camaraderie of working together for the 5000-
5200 block of Lotus, tragedy struck on January
5, 2014 when one of the men, Mr. Orin Clark
passed away after shoveling snow at his home;
and

WHEREAS, In January 2014 there was
a historic amount of snowfall in the City of
St. Louis and the snowfall reached a height
which made it impossible for the City of St.
Louis to plow the City’s side streets yet, it
was imperative to have the 5000-5200 blocks
Lotus clear of snow and ice from the streets
for the grieving family of Mr. Clark who were
planning their loved one’s funeral service; and
WHEREAS, The four remaining friends
discussed a possible solution to the snow
dilemma and their solution was to clear the
street of snow and ice themselves. Therefore,
one cold day in January 2014, Mr. Clark’s
four  friends  worked  tirelessly  from  early
morning until late afternoon to clear the street
and sewer drains, of snow and ice so that by
evening the entire triple blocks of Lotus was
clear making way for the grieving family and
friends of Mr. Clark to park on the street
during their time of mourning; and

WHEREAS, There is constant search
for people, especially men who are willing to
volunteer and serve in our communities and
thereby set an examples for the next generation
of  what  true  community  means  and  set
examples through their actions of some of the
things a real man does  to help his community;
and

WHEREAS,  The  residents  of  Lotus
Avenue are grateful to the men who live on
their  block  who  are  willing  to  give  of
themselves for the peace and safety of the
community and look forward to these men
continuing to be a beacon of light for our
community  to  follow.   As  such  the  four
surviving men have begun plans for the 2014
Block Party/Family Reunion whose motto is,
“The Neighborhoods of North St. Louis are
Wonderful Places to Live and Together We
Can Make it Better”; and

WHEREAS, There is often negative
attention given to those who do the wrong
thing but very little attention and appreciation
for those who everyday do the right thing or
for those who go above and beyond their duty
in doing the right thing.

NOW  THEREFORE  BE 

IT
RESOLVED,  That  the  Members  of  this
Honorable  Board  of Aldermen  join  the
sponsor of this resolution and the residents
of  Lotus  in  expressing  their  deepest
appreciation and heartfelt thank you to, Mr.
Jimmy  Latimore,  Mr.  Larry  Hearn,  Mr.
Moddia  Reid,  and  Mr.  John Weaver  and
posthumously to Mr. Orin Clark, for their
service and commitment to; the 5000-5200
Block  of  Lotus,  the  Kingsway  West
Neighborhood  and  the  City  of  St.  Louis,
Missouri.

BE IT FUTHER RESOLVED, That the
Chief  Clerk  of  this  Honorable  Board  of
Aldermen be instructed to prepare properly
inscribed copies of this resolution to present
to Mr. Jimmy Latimore, Mr. Larry Hearn,
Mr. Moddia Reid, and Mr. John Weaver and
to  the  family  of  Mr.  Orin  Clark,  at  the

Resolution No. 91

Phi Beta Sigma Fraternity
WHEREAS, Phi Beta Sigma Fraternity
was  founded  at  Howard  University  in
Washington, D.C., January 9, 1914, by three
young African-American male students. The
Founders,  Honorable A.  Langston Taylor,
Honorable Leonard F. Morse, and Honorable
Charles I. Brown, wanted to organize a Greek
letter fraternity that would truly exemplify
the ideals of brotherhood, scholarship; and

July 8, 2014

    The City Journal

          11

WHEREAS,  The  Founders  deeply
wished to create an organization that viewed
itself as “a part of” the general community
rather  than  “apart  from”  the  general
community. They believed that each potential
member should be judged by his own merits,
rather  than  his  family  background  or
affluence…without regard to race, nationality,
skin tone or texture of hair. They desired for
their fraternity to exist as part of an even
greater brotherhood which would be devoted
to the “inclusive we” rather than the “exclusive
we”; and

WHEREAS,  from  its  inception,  the
Founders also conceived Phi Beta Sigma as a
mechanism to deliver services to the general
community. Rather than gaining skills to be
utilized exclusively for themselves and their
immediate  families,  they  held  a  deep
conviction that they should return their newly
acquired skills to the communities from which
they had come. This deep conviction was
mirrored in the Fraternity’s motto, “Culture
for Service and Service for Humanity”; and

WHEREAS, Today, Phi Beta Sigma has
blossomed into an international organization
of leaders. No longer a single entity, members
of the Fraternity have been instrumental in
the  establishment  of  the  Phi  Beta  Sigma
National  Foundation,  the  Phi  Beta  Sigma
Federal Credit Union and The Sigma Beta Club
Foundation.; and

WHEREAS, The brothers of Phi Beta
Sigma  are  the  Fraternity’s  most  valuable
resource and strength. They are the primary
means by which the Phi Beta Sigma objectives
will be achieved. In order to accomplish the
Fraternity’s  objectives,  it  is  essential  that
systems are instituted that effectively embody
“Culture  for  Service  and  Service  for
Humanity”  and  promote  brotherhood,
scholarship; and

WHEREAS,  To  optimize  Phi  Beta
Sigma’s  effectiveness,  the  Fraternity  will
Strengthen  and  serve  proactively  the
brotherhood, as a supportive resource that
positively impacts the Fraternity’s growth and
financial solvency. Reaffirm and maintain a
strong  commitment  to  brotherhood,
scholarship  and  service.  Ensure  that  the
Fraternity  programs  are  focused  and
committed to serving humanity. Create an
environment that respects the dignity and
worth of each brother. Exhibit integrity and
ethical behavior in conducting the Fraternity’s
business, serving as a model for all Greek-
letter organizations. Maintain and improve the
Fraternity’s technological literacy, in order to
better service its members and the community
at large. Encourage a closer and mutually

NOW  THEREFORE  BE 

beneficial working relationship with fellow
Greek-letter organizations, other community
service  organizations,  businesses  and
government. Select leaders who are committed
and have demonstrated their ability to lead.
IT
RESOLVED by the Board of Aldermen of
the City of St. Louis, that we pause in our
deliberations  to  recognize  and  honor  the
members Phi Beta Sigma Fraternity and we
thank them for their tireless efforts for over
100 years of excellence and on behalf of the
citizens of this community we direct the Clerk
of this Board to prepare a commemorative
copy of this Resolution to the end that it may
be presented to our honorees at a time and
place deemed appropriate by the Sponsor.

Resolution No. 92

Bishop T. Larry Kirkland, Sr.
WHEREAS, Bishop T. Larry Kirkland
received his early education in the Jefferson
County  Public  Schools  of  Birmingham,
Alabama. His preparation for ministry began
under the tutelage of his father Rev. H.E.
Kirkland, (an AME minister of over 50 years)
and from his mother Gladys, (an educator).
He received a B.A. Degree in Sociology from
Alcorn State University and a Masters from
Mississippi  State  University.    He  further
developed  his  ministry  through  higher
education  at  The  Claremont  School  of
Theology and the California Graduate School
of Theology.  Bishop Kirkland’s education,
along with his experiences as an educator and
football coach, prepared him for the rigors
and challenges of being an effective pastor;
and

WHEREAS, prior to being elevated to
the Episcopacy, Bishop Kirkland served in
the “Favored Fifth” for twenty years as the
popular pastor of Brookins Community AME
Church in Los Angeles, California and in the
Eighth Episcopal District (LA, MS).  Upon
his arrival in Los Angeles, many ministers
dubbed him “A Down Home Preacher” as an
insult  to  his  southern  roots  and  style  of
worship.  The then pastor, who possesses an
extraordinary love for people and their needs,
took that insult as a challenge and armed with
an anointing and an awareness of the power
of the word of God and the southern lineage
of most Angelinos; and

WHEREAS,  the  Bishop  began  to
distinguish himself as a pastor and grew the
mission church of twelve members, into a
congregation of more than eight thousand.
While at Brookins he established a strong social
and political AME presence in the city of Los

Angeles and the West Coast where he is now
affectionately known as “The Down Home
Preacher with the Uptown Message.”  The
Bishop maintains his ties with the city’s most
influential and plans to develop the District
both socially and spiritually; and

WHEREAS, Bishop T. Larry Kirkland
was elected and consecrated the one hundred
and  fourteenth  Bishop  of  the  African
Methodist  Episcopal  Church  in  1996  in
Louisville, Kentucky.  He received his first
assignment  to  the  Seventeenth  Episcopal
District which encompasses the countries of
Zaire, Zambia, Tanzania, Rwanda, Burundi,
Malawi and Zimbabwe.  After four years of
International service in the 17th District; the
General Conference of 2000 assigned Bishop
Kirkland to serve as the Ecumenical Officer
representing the denomination all over the
world.   In 2001, he served as the President of
the  Council  of  Bishops  and  in  2002,  was
assigned to serve his birth state (Alabama),
the “Notable Ninth” Episcopal District.  This
gave him the distinct pleasure of holding two
offices simultaneously.  He is credited with
implementing  a  District-wide  community
outreach  program  that  included  computer
literacy training and health services for the
uninsured.  Health Services were provided
from  the  newly  erected,  state-of-the-art
medical facility located on the 167 acre campus
of  Daniel  Payne/Nichols-Thomas-Grady
School  of  Religion.  In  2008,  the  General
Conference assigned Bishop Kirkland to the
“Favored  Fifth”  Episcopal  District  which
includes fifteen Western interior and coastal
states, Alaska and India.; and

WHEREAS, Bishop Kirkland for over
40 years has placed himself in the company
of  presidents,  government  officials,  and
celebrity personalities.   He has been featured
in magazines and was seen by the world via
satellite  welcoming  then  Senator  Barack
Obama  to  Brown  Chapel AME  Church’s
observance of Bloody Sunday.  He is the
author of several books on church growth and
continues to be consulted by both Christian
and civic organizations.    His preaching style
and ability to develop strong relationships
across denominational and cultural lines have
garnered him respect and standing invitations
with some of the nation’s greatest ministries.
Bishop Kirkland is married to Mrs. Mary L.
Simon-Kirkland and is the proud father of
three adult children and the grandfather of one.
IT
RESOLVED by the Board of Aldermen of
the City of St. Louis, that we pause in our
deliberations to recognize and honor Bishop
T. Larry Kirkland, Sr. and we direct the Clerk

SECTION  ONE.  Section  One,  part
86.040, Ordinance 56716 is hereby repealed.
SECTION  TWO.  Enacted  in  lieu

thereof is the following new section.

5.58.040 - Opening of bids.
A. Proposals shall be opened at the time
and place fixed by the advertisement, in the
presence  of  such  bidders  as  desire  to  be
present, and shall be open to the inspection
of bidders.

B.  The  bids  shall  not  be  materially
modified or amended as to price, specification
or otherwise, nor substitutions placed thereon,
after opening except when the lowest bid is
from a non-local bidder. When the lowest bid
is from a non-local bidder, any local bidder
within two percent of the lowest bid may
match the lowest bid. If a local bidder matches
the lowest bid, then the Supply Commissioner
may select the bid from the local bidder. If
more  than  one  local  bidder  is  within  two
percent of the lowest bid, then only the lowest
local bidder may match the bid. In all other
circumstances, modification, supplementation

For purposes of this chapter, local bidder
means  a  bidder  whose  principal  place  of
business is within the City of St. Louis, has
had a valid business license for at least one
year, and is current in payment of local taxes.
Principal place of business shall be defined as
the business’s physical office, plant, or site
where  a  majority  (51%)  of  the  full-time
employees, chief officer, and managers of the
business regularly work and conduct business,
or where the plant or office and equipment
required for the furnishing of the goods or
performance of the services provided to the
City, as required by the contract, are physically
located in the City of St. Louis for at least one
taxable year immediately prior to the date of
the bid.

C. Bids may be for one or more or all the
articles advertised for, but there shall be a
specific bid on each article. The award may be
made to the lowest bidder for any article, or

or  any  part  thereof,  but  the  Board  of
Standardization may reject any or all bids or
any part of any bid.

SECTION THREE. Severability.
The  provisions  of  this  section  are
severable. If any provision of this ordinance
is declared invalid, that invalidity shall not
