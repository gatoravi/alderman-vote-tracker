COURTESY RESOLUTIONS

CONSENT CALENDAR

President  Reed introduced Resolution
No. 162 through 167 and No. 169 and the
Clerk was instructed to read same.
Resolution No. 162

Girl Scouts of

Eastern Missouri-District 3
WHEREAS, in 1912 Juliette Gordon
Low formed the first troop of 18 girls, in
Savannah, Georgia.  The Girl Scout Council
of Greater St. Louis (GSCGSL) Troop #1 was
organized in 1918  In 1922 St. Louis received
its first charter from the Girl Scouts of United
States of America.  In 1928 Girl scouting came
to the City of St. Louis District 3.  The first
African American troop was formed by Miss
Cleotla Spotts, a teacher at Charles Sumner
High School.  A troop also established at Lane
Tabernacle C.M.E. Church. In 1930 Marie
Webb,  leader  at  Central  Baptist  Church
developed the first “buddy troop”, uniting
Temple Israel troop with the Central Baptist
Troop in a cultural exchange; and

WHEREAS,  District  3  Girl  Scouts
contributed to the war effort by assisting local
citizens Defense Corps; conducting salvage
drives; purchasing and selling war bonds and
stamps;  cultivating  victory  gardens;  and
adopting  local  servicemen.    In  1954  Girl
scouting was integrated nationally; and

WHEREAS,  a  nationwide  project,
Action 70, stimulated great interest in Girl
Scouting among inner-city groups.  District 3
Girl Scout programs traditionally offered at
city neighborhood schools, were adversely
affected by the new desegregation plan, while
those Girl Scout programs centered in private
and parochial schools remained strong.  To
counteract the loss of traditional troops in
public  schools,  GSCGSL  developed
innovative  programs  which  could  be
implemented through churches, community
and youth centers.  In 1976 a Day Camp in
District 3 was established as a collaborative
project with Ascension Episcopal Church; and
WHEREAS,  District  3  increased  its
collaboration with community agencies in its
role as advocate for youth.  Issues involving
healthcare, crime prevention, juvenile justice,

troubled  families,  youth  with  disabilities,
energy  conservation,  and  environmental
concerns received the attention and expertise
of the Girl Scout Organization.  1 In 996 more
than 70 administrative volunteers, council
trainers and staff members attended District
3’s annual dinner meeting a the Salad Bowl
Restaurant.  This represents the commitment
and involvement of those volunteers who lead
and directed Girl Scouting in District 3; and
WHEREAS, through its flexibility and
integrity, its concern for girls and caring adults,
District  3  continues  to  demonstrate  its
relevance  and  vitality  in  a  contemporary
world.  Girl Scouting was extended to homeless
shelters, offered special summer programs and
training opportunities for older girls and adults.
Rally  Day  Outreach  programs  were
implemented at facilities throughout the city
of St. Louis to give girls an opportunity to
learn  about  Girl  Scouting.    Today,  Girl
Scouting in District 3 builds girls of courage,
confidence  and  character.    Leaders  and
volunteers work to improve the quality of life
for girls so they can discover their personal
best, connect with others and take action to
improve their communities.

NOW  THEREFORE  BE 

IT
RESOLVED by the Board of Aldermen of

Scouts of Eastern Missouri-District 3and we

of bidders.

B.  The  bids  shall  not  be  materially

is from a non-local bidder, any local bidder

year, and is current in payment of local taxes.
