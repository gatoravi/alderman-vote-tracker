to the opening of bids, codified as Section
5.58.040 of the Revised Code of the City of

same subject matter which allows a local bidder
to match the lowest bid when the lowest bid

provision  on  the  same  subject  matter;
containing severability clause.

in the City;

WHEREAS,  the  City  of  St.  Louis

WHEREAS,  by  enacting  a  local

year, and is current in payment of local taxes.
