WHEREAS, Edna taught and created a
love of learning to hundreds of children who
will grow up, maybe not  remembering her
name, but always remembering the feeling of
love and safety they experienced in her care;

WHEREAS, pre-school teachers are
special and Edna was no exception; she let
kids ring bells with reckless abandon (no

tears, wiped noses and bottoms, and created
life-long friendships with dozens of parents
and children; Edna made a difference; and

WHEREAS, now it is time for Edna to
relax and enjoy her memories of baking pies
for  the  annual  harvest  party,  impromptu
parades around the building, moving furniture,
welcoming new families, and the thousands
of free hugs she received over the last thirty
years.

Resolution No. 99

Resolution Urging Voters to

Oppose Amendment 7 Sales Tax
Increase on August 5, 2014 Ballot
WHEREAS, voters will be deciding on
Missouri constitutional Amendment 7 at the
election to be held on August 5, 2014; and

metropolitan area in the nation and also have
the lowest rate of highway congestion; and,
WHEREAS,  the  burden  of  this  tax
increase will fall most heavily on families,
seniors, those with modest incomes, and small
businesses, rather than on the users of the
highway system; and

WHEREAS,  the  trucking  industry,
which does the most damage to roads and
bridges, is exempt from state and local sales
and use taxes; and

WHEREAS,  because Amendment  7
prohibits increases in motor fuel taxes and the
imposition of tolls, those who benefit the most
from this huge tax increase will pay virtually
none of it, both now and likely forever; and
WHEREAS,  the  Missouri  General
Assembly  in  the  last  session  approved
legislation that will reduce income taxes for
the highest earners; and

WHEREAS, the state of Missouri is
cutting  budgets  for  essential  services  like
education,  safety,  social  services  and
healthcare; and

are 

safety 

WHEREAS, claims that Amendment 7
will produce thousands of permanent jobs and
improve 
completely
unsubstantiated and greatly exaggerated; and
WHEREAS, the City of St. Louis has
proposed a number of potentially beneficial
projects  that  could  be  paid  for  with  the
proceeds of the sales tax increase; and

WHEREAS, Amendment 7 increases
both state sales and use taxes by ¾% for ten
years  to  create  a  fund  controlled  by  the
Missouri  Highway  and  Transportation
Commission to be used for transportation
improvements; and

WHEREAS, the $6 billion or more that
will be collected from the proposed sales and
use tax increase is the largest tax increase in
the history of the state of Missouri; and

WHEREAS, this increase would result
in the general sales tax rate in the City of St.
Louis climbing to 9.429%, with the rate in
special districts as high as 11.429%; and

WHEREAS,  the  tax  increase  is
excessive, considering that the vast majority
of the funds from this tax will be used to build
highways and bridges, growing a state highway
system  that  is  already  one  of  the  most
expansive in the nation; and

WHEREAS, the St. Louis and Kansas
City metropolitan regions already have the
most freeway pavement per capita of any large

WHEREAS, the Missouri Highways
and Transportation Commission will be solely
responsible for deciding how the sales tax
proceeds will be spent; and

WHEREAS,  the  portion  of  the
proposed sales tax increase paid by citizens
and businesses in the City of St. Louis will be
greater than the portion of the expenditures
to be made in the City; and

WHEREAS, the continued expansion of
the highway system in suburban areas of the
state  will  encourage  unsustainable
development patterns that are harmful to the
St. Louis region and the City of St. Louis; and
WHEREAS, the sales tax increase will
diminish the future fiscal capacity of the City
by limiting the use of this revenue source to
meet  future  needs  for  essential  services,
support  for  Metro,  and  the  expansion  of
MetroLink; and

WHEREAS, Amendment 7 is opposed
by the Missouri Municipal League, the St.
Louis County Municipal League, the League
of Women Voters, the Sierra Club, Missouri

Coalition for the Environment, and many other
groups whose interests are generally aligned
with the City of St. Louis; and

WHEREAS, any benefits to the City of
St. Louis of the sales tax increase are uncertain
and  largely  outweighed  by  the  cost  to  its
citizens and businesses.

NOW  THEREFORE,  BE  IT
RESOLVED  BY  THE  BOARD  OF
ALDERMEN  OF  THE  CITY  OF  ST.
LOUIS, THAT the sales and use tax increases
that  would  be  imposed  by  passage  of
Amendment 7  are excessive, unfair, harmful,
and  the  wrong  priority  for  the  State  of
Missouri and the City of St. Louis.

BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the
Board of Aldermen of the City of St. Louis
urges voters to vote NO on Amendment 7 at
the election to be held on August 5, 2014

Committee Substitute As Amended

An Ordinance repealing Section One,
part 86.040 of Ordinance 56716, pertaining
to the opening of bids, codified as Section
5.58.040 of the Revised Code of the City of
St. Louis, and enacting a new provision on the
same subject matter which allows a local bidder
to match the lowest bid when the lowest bid
is from a non-local bidder; enacting a new
provision  on  the  same  subject  matter;
containing severability clause.

WHEREAS, local businesses which seek
to enter into contracts with the City of St.
Louis are at a competitive disadvantage with
businesses from other areas because of the
higher administrative costs of doing business
in the City;

WHEREAS,  the  City  of  St.  Louis
desires to encourage businesses to remain in
the City and to relocate to the City;

WHEREAS,  by  enacting  a  local
preference law that allows a local firm to match
the  lowest  bid  when  its  bid  is  within  2%
percent of the lowest bid, the City hopes to
encourage and stimulate local business.

BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF

ST. LOUIS AS FOLLOWS:

SECTION  ONE.  Section  One,  part
86.040, Ordinance 56716 is hereby repealed.
SECTION  TWO.  Enacted  in  lieu

thereof is the following new section.

5.58.040 - Opening of bids.
A. Proposals shall be opened at the time
and place fixed by the advertisement, in the

presence  of  such  bidders  as  desire  to  be
present, and shall be open to the inspection
of bidders.

B.  The  bids  shall  not  be  materially
modified or amended as to price, specification
or otherwise, nor substitutions placed thereon,
after opening except when the lowest bid is
from a non-local bidder. When the lowest bid
is from a non-local bidder, any local bidder
within two percent of the lowest bid may
match the lowest bid. If a local bidder matches
the lowest bid, then the Supply Commissioner
may select the bid from the local bidder. If
more  than  one  local  bidder  is  within  two
percent of the lowest bid, then only the lowest
local bidder may match the bid. In all other
circumstances, modification, supplementation
or amendment shall cause rejection of the bid.
For purposes of this chapter, local bidder
means  a  bidder  whose  principal  place  of
business is within the City of St. Louis, has
had a valid business license for at least one
year, and is current in payment of local taxes.
Principal place of business shall be defined as
the business’s physical office, plant, or site
where  a  majority  (51%)  of  the  full-time
employees, chief officer, and managers of the
business regularly work and conduct business,
or where the plant or office and equipment
required for the furnishing of the goods or
performance of the services provided to the
City, as required by the contract, are physically
located in the City of St. Louis for at least one
taxable year immediately prior to the date of
the bid.

C. Bids may be for one or more or all the
articles advertised for, but there shall be a
specific bid on each article. The award may be
made to the lowest bidder for any article, or
to the lowest bidder for the entire requisition
or  any  part  thereof,  but  the  Board  of
Standardization may reject any or all bids or
any part of any bid.

SECTION THREE. Severability.
The  provisions  of  this  section  are
severable. If any provision of this ordinance
is declared invalid, that invalidity shall not
affect other provisions of the ordinance which
can  be  given  effect  without  the  invalid
provision.
