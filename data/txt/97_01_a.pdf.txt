leaders are hard at work at every level, from
block captain to CEO, making the City of St.

livable and sustainable; and

WHEREAS, leaders throughout the bi-

thriving central city and the role the State and

reality; and

Overland starkly contrasts with smart growth
principles that encourage investment in high
density, walkable and easily-accessed urban
centers; and

WHEREAS, the Obama Administra-
tion’s  own  Partnership  for  Sustainable

communities that have a variety of housing

“Recommendations for Sustainable Locations
for Federal Facilities,” encourages federal jobs
to be sited in areas served by transit, that are
safe and convenient for pedestrians and near
affordable housing; and

WHEREAS, walk-in services provided
by the downtown offices steer veteran’s, some
of whom are homeless and living nearby,
towards the various services and benefits VA
offers and will not be easily accesses after the
move; and

lead of Kansas City and consolidate these
Federal  jobs  in  the  regional  center  of
commerce-downtown.

to the opening of bids, codified as Section
5.58.040 of the Revised Code of the City of

provision  on  the  same  subject  matter;
containing severability clause.

higher administrative costs of doing business
in the City;

desires to encourage businesses to remain in

WHEREAS,  by  enacting  a  local
preference law that allows a local firm to match

SECTION  ONE.  Section  One,  part

of bidders.

B.  The  bids  shall  not  be  materially
modified or amended as to price, specification
or otherwise, nor substitutions placed thereon,
after opening except when the lowest bid is
from a non-local bidder. When the lowest bid
is from a non-local bidder, any local bidder
within two percent of the lowest bid may
match the lowest bid. If a local bidder matches
the lowest bid, then the Supply Commissioner
may select the bid from the local bidder. If
more  than  one  local  bidder  is  within  two
percent of the lowest bid, then only the lowest
local bidder may match the bid. In all other
circumstances, modification, supplementation
or amendment shall cause rejection of the bid.
For purposes of this chapter, local bidder
means  a  bidder  whose  principal  place  of
business is within the City of St. Louis, has
had a valid business license for at least one
year, and is current in payment of local taxes.
Principal place of business shall be defined as
the business’s physical office, plant, or site
where  a  majority  (51%)  of  the  full-time
employees, chief officer, and managers of the
business regularly work and conduct business,
or where the plant or office and equipment
required for the furnishing of the goods or
performance of the services provided to the
City, as required by the contract, are physically
located in the City of St. Louis for at least one
taxable year immediately prior to the date of
the bid.

C. Bids may be for one or more or all the
articles advertised for, but there shall be a
specific bid on each article. The award may be
made to the lowest bidder for any article, or
to the lowest bidder for the entire requisition
or  any  part  thereof,  but  the  Board  of
Standardization may reject any or all bids or
any part of any bid.

SECTION THREE. Severability.
The  provisions  of  this  section  are
severable. If any provision of this ordinance
is declared invalid, that invalidity shall not
affect other provisions of the ordinance which
can  be  given  effect  without  the  invalid
provision.
Approved: April 29, 2013
