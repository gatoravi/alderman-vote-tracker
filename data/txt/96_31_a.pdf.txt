CONSENT CALENDAR

President Reed introduced Resolutions
No. 133 through 135 and No. 137 through
138 and the Clerk was instructed to read same.

Resolution No. 133

SEA 30th Reunion Class of ‘83

WHEREAS, St. Elizabeth Academy,
located at  3401 Arsenal Street opened in 1882
as an all girl Catholic High School; and

WHEREAS, in the Fall of 1979 a  young
class of  bright women arrived, ready for new
experiences;  new  people  to  meet,  new
uniforms, no boys, new teachers, a schedule
with “mods” that seemed like a puzzle, new
things to do; and

WHEREAS, the Class of ’83 soon felt
at home and very comfortable at SEA.  The
young freshmen women made their first high
school retreat, held at the St. Mary’s Sisters
Motherhouse, where they learned much about
themselves and bonded tremendously with
their classmates.  Their enthusiasm carried over
into Spirit Week as the girls showed lots of
energy and they truly were “hopping with
spirit.” and

WHEREAS, in 1981 this young class
came back as sophomores, with a confidence
that could not be mistaken.   The bonds had
formed, and friendships that would last 30
years had only just begun. That year, the entire
school knew the sophomores meant business,
when they won the Annual Penny Walk. More
connections  were  made  as  their  journey
continued that November during their retreat
to Mercy; and

WHEREAS,  in  1982  St.  Elizabeth
Academy celebrated its 100th anniversary
with a city-wide Centennial celebration and
parade.  Mayor Vince Schomehl proclaimed
Sept 1st Centennial Day and Tennessee Street
became St. Elizabeth Avenue. The Class of
’83  represented  the  school  with  a  cookie
monster float and one of our own leading the
parade carrying the school flag. By this time,
lifelong  friendships  had  been  formed  and
families had been joined together as the Class
of ’83 moved closer towards senior year and
graduation; and

WHEREAS, 1982 had finally arrived
and so had the Class of 1983.  Four years
later, we received our rings; special to our class

                                  October 22, 2013

symbolizing  our  ties  with  St.  Elizabeth
Academy,  with  our  classmates,  with  the
future. We were now the Big Sisters, Snoopy
was our mascot, the pink rose was our flower,
and “The Times of Our Lives” had just begun.
After hundreds of classes, tons of laughter, a
few trips to the principal’s office, this was a
special year.  The book was closed on our
Centennial celebrations and we are the first
graduates of the new century. (Not to mention
our St. Louis Cardinals went all the way won
the World Series right here in town and as
seniors we won for Spirit Week with Snoopy
at bat).

NOW  THEREFORE  BE 

IT
RESOLVED by the Board of Aldermen of
the City of St. Louis that we pause in our
deliberations to recognize the Class of 1983
on the occasion of their 30th High School
Reunion and wish them well as they celebrate
with Mass and a social gathering at Bartolino’s.
We further direct the Clerk of this Board to
spread a copy of this Resolution across the
minutes of these proceedings and to prepare a
commemorative copy to the end that it may
be presented to our honoree at a time and
place deemed appropriate by the Sponsor.

Resolution No. 135

The 40th Anniversary of the

Metropolitan Community Church

of Greater Saint Louis

WHEREAS, Metropolitan Community
Church  of  Greater  Saint  Louis  began  in
October 1973. Their first worship service was
held at the Berea Presbyterian Church at 3010
Olive  Street.    This  October  28th  worship
service was attended by about a dozen people
and  was  affiliated  with  the  Universal
Fellowship  of  Metropolitan  Community
Churches (MCC). They received our MCC
charter in April 21, 1974. At the time, MCC
had about sixty congregations or missions. St.
Louis  had  no  organized  “homosexual”
organization existing at that time; and

WHEREAS, by December 23, 1974, the
group of about 150 members had purchased a
home in the Central West End. The acquisition
of the house at 5108 Waterman, according to
the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, was believed to
“mark the first time in Missouri that any self-
proclaimed homosexual group has owned its
own facilities.”; and

WHEREAS, several years later, in 1984,
they purchased a beautiful, old church building
near downtown St. Louis, in the Lafayette
area.    Constructed  in  1870  as  St.  John’s
Episcopal Church, the 1120 Dolman building
was taken over by the St. Mary’s Assumption
Ukrainian Rite congregation early in the 20th
century; and

WHEREAS, in the 1990’s, they sold the
Dolman  property  because  of  financial
considerations.  In 1997, they leased space at
the  St.  John’s  Methodist  Church  on
Washington Place, in the Central West End.
They continued to meet social challenges and
church changes. Soon after moving to the
rented space we experienced a big growth
spurt.   They became even more visible in the
community and collaborated with many other
organizations.  In addition to continuing to
work  with  LGBT  groups,  they  began  a
partnership with a city group called MCU -
Metropolitan  Congregations  United,  an
interfaith, ecumenical organization dealing
with political and social issues in St. Louis
city, and beyond; and

WHEREAS, in the 2000s, they began a

October 22, 2013

    The City Journal

             19

search for a new, permanent home.   On January
1,  2007,  they  left  they  rented  space  on
Washington Blvd. and (temporarily) moved
our  worship  service  to  a  catering  hall  in
Soulard. On the day of that move, someone
noticed  a  “for  sale”  sign  at  their  current
building, just a dozen blocks away, ultimately
resulting in the acquisition of the property;
and

WHEREAS,  during  this  time,  they
became  more  diverse,  increasing African
American,  transgender  and  straight
membership, allowing them to do more diverse
community outreach.  They expanded our
offerings  for  children  and  young  adult
programs.  They participated in numerous
community  events,  with  substantial
involvement in the AIDS Walk, Metropolitan
Congregations  United  (MCU)  events,  St.
Louis Pride, and Komen Race for the Cure.
We’ve supported and worked with groups like
HRC,  Food  Outreach,  Gateway  Men’s
Chorus, Charis, Band Together and Black
Pride Festival; and

WHEREAS, most recently, their much-
celebrated  choir  won  the  2011  Verizon
Wireless Regional Competition for Gospel
Choirs called “How Sweet the Sound.” In
2012, our church received recognition from
Interfaith  Power  and  Light  as  a  “Cool
Congregation” for our green and sustainability
programs and projects.

NOW  THEREFORE  BE 

IT
RESOLVED by the Board of Aldermen of
the City of St. Louis that we pause in our
deliberations  to  recognize  the  40th
Anniversary of the Metropolitan Community
Church of Greater Saint Louis and we direct
the Clerk of this Board to spread a copy of
this Resolution across the minutes of these
proceedings  and  to  further  prepare  a
commemorative copy to the end that it may
be presented to our honorees at a time and
place deemed appropriate by the Sponsor.

An Ordinance repealing Section One,
part 86.040 of Ordinance 56716, pertaining
to the opening of bids, codified as Section
5.58.040 of the Revised Code of the City of
St. Louis, and enacting a new provision on the
same subject matter which allows a local bidder
to match the lowest bid when the lowest bid
is from a non-local bidder; enacting a new
provision  on  the  same  subject  matter;
containing severability clause.

WHEREAS, local businesses which seek
to enter into contracts with the City of St.
Louis are at a competitive disadvantage with
businesses from other areas because of the
higher administrative costs of doing business
in the City;

WHEREAS,  the  City  of  St.  Louis
desires to encourage businesses to remain in
the City and to relocate to the City;

WHEREAS,  by  enacting  a  local
preference law that allows a local firm to match
the  lowest  bid  when  its  bid  is  within  2%
percent of the lowest bid, the City hopes to

encourage and stimulate local business.

BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF

ST. LOUIS AS FOLLOWS:

SECTION  ONE.  Section  One,  part
86.040, Ordinance 56716 is hereby repealed.
SECTION  TWO.  Enacted  in  lieu

thereof is the following new section.

5.58.040 - Opening of bids.
A. Proposals shall be opened at the time
and place fixed by the advertisement, in the
presence  of  such  bidders  as  desire  to  be
present, and shall be open to the inspection
of bidders.

B.  The  bids  shall  not  be  materially
modified or amended as to price, specification
or otherwise, nor substitutions placed thereon,
after opening except when the lowest bid is
from a non-local bidder. When the lowest bid
is from a non-local bidder, any local bidder
within two percent of the lowest bid may
match the lowest bid. If a local bidder matches
the lowest bid, then the Supply Commissioner
may select the bid from the local bidder. If
more  than  one  local  bidder  is  within  two
percent of the lowest bid, then only the lowest
local bidder may match the bid. In all other
circumstances, modification, supplementation
or amendment shall cause rejection of the bid.
For purposes of this chapter, local bidder
means  a  bidder  whose  principal  place  of
business is within the City of St. Louis, has
had a valid business license for at least one
year, and is current in payment of local taxes.
Principal place of business shall be defined as
the business’s physical office, plant, or site
where  a  majority  (51%)  of  the  full-time
employees, chief officer, and managers of the
business regularly work and conduct business,
or where the plant or office and equipment
required for the furnishing of the goods or
performance of the services provided to the
City, as required by the contract, are physically
located in the City of St. Louis for at least one
taxable year immediately prior to the date of
the bid.

C. Bids may be for one or more or all the
articles advertised for, but there shall be a
specific bid on each article. The award may be
made to the lowest bidder for any article, or
to the lowest bidder for the entire requisition
or  any  part  thereof,  but  the  Board  of
Standardization may reject any or all bids or
any part of any bid.

is declared invalid, that invalidity shall not
