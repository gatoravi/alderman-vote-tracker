Resolution No. 149
Ronald Kennedy

WHEREAS, Ronald Kennedy was born
on July 12, 1941. Family members describe
Ronald  as  a  quiet  youth  with  a  serious
demeanor, a “can do” attitude, a wicked sense
of humor and a colorful personality. He was
always offering good advice to anyone who
would listen. His excitement was contagious
as he shared all kinds of new mechanical
inventions or new projects to you. He was
never bored or boring. If you needed him, he
was there. Period. When you called, he came;
and

WHEREAS, Ronald’s parents Samuel
and Frances (Johnson) Kennedy cherished
their children: Ronald, Joyce, Katherine, Terry
and Gary. Ronald was the eldest of the five.
Ronald was nicknamed “Butch”, a name many
feared or respected. Ronald helped a lot of
people in the neighborhood and across the
metro  area.  Kathy  said  her  brother  was  a
“hero”. His other sister Joyce said Ronald’s
philosophy in life was to challenge any and
all obstacles with fervor always with a “can
do” attitude.; and

WHEREAS, before Ron graduated from
high school at the age of 17 he enlisted in the
Marine Corps. He served on active duty as a
Mortar Shell Carrier in the Second Marine
Corps Division. His brother Gary re-told the
story of Ronald’s heroism one weekend while
on leave in  Mexico.  Ronald and one of his
Mexican friends were both arrested in Mexico
but Ronald was quickly  released. Ronald went
back to the base to get some weapons and
mobilize other Marines to go rescue his friend.

Everything worked out and his fellow Marines
recognized  Ronald’s  type  of  loyalty  and
heroism. Ronald served in the Marines for
four years and two more years in the MC
Reserves.

WHEREAS,  Ronald  grew  up  in  a
political family. He helped run various political
campaigns over a 45 year span for aldermanic
races in the 18th Ward initially for his father
and later his brother Terry.  He held organize
the workers on the polls and helped support
the work of the political party. He also shared
invaluable political strategies and advice to
the Aldermen Kennedy’s Campaign Manager.
In his own career, Ronald worked for ten years
as Sheriff in the City of St. Louis. He received
several commendations, including one for
apprehending a suspect without firing one
single bullet. The department labeled Ronald
a “hero” ; and

WHEREAS, after leaving the Sheriff’s
Department, Ronald worked with his uncle
Hallester Kennedy who owned a bail bond
company.  His  uncle  also  owned  rental
property.  He  taught  Ronald  how  to  rehab
homes installing plumbing, electrical wiring,
painting, carpentry and flooring. He created
an apprenticeship program and taught youth
and  young  adults  how  to  do  many  of  the
trades. Ronald was known as a “jack-of-all-
trades” and later became a General Contractor.
Because he recognized his natural skills and
high  intelligence,  Uncle  Hallester  tricked
Ronald into taking his GED test by giving
him  a  dare;  he  passed  his  GED  without
studying one day for it. Ronald later attended
Forest  Park  and  completed  his Associate
Degree; and

WHEREAS, Ronald also supported the
growth of small and non profit businesses.
He was also there to help support the work
of Progressive Emporium & Education Center,
Sudan Illustrators, TEACH Society and other
cultural arts groups; and

WHEREAS, Ronald is preceded in death
by his parents, Samuel and Frances  Kennedy.
He  leaves  to  celebrate  his  life;  children,
Valencia Kennedy, Timothy Kennedy, Ronald
Powell, former spouse Gwen Frierson, Uncle
William  [Floyd]  Johnson  (Maria);  sisters
Joyce  Kennedy  and  Katherine  Kennedy,
(Terry) Holt;  twin brothers Terry Kennedy
and Gary Kennedy; a host of grandchildren
and great grandchildren, a number of loving
friends and family.

NOW  THEREFORE  BE 

IT
RESOLVED by the Board of Aldermen of
the  City  of  St.  Louis  that  we  pause  to
remember the life of Ronald Kennedy and we
