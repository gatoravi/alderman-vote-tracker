Newspaper with a “Thank You” award; and

“These  stories  have  helped  to  raise  the
consciousness  of  men  in  the  St.  Louis
community  about  prostate  cancer,  prostate
health and prostate awareness,” said Mellve
Shahid Sr., TEN’s founder and CEO. “Because
of The St. Louis American, prostate cancer is
no longer a whisper. Men are now taking that
simple blood test with more ease, comfort
and  less  fear.”  Shahid  recalled  that  the
newspaper  was  part  his  prostate  cancer
journey  before  TEN,  when  he  was  a  five-
month  prostate  cancer  survivor  on  a  solo
mission. “The newspaper was there to carry
the first story about me”; and

ethnic groups - and 2 ½ times more likely to
die from the disease; and

WHEREAS,  TEN  provides  support,
awareness, educational and health resources

lives by using the power of the public and
private  sector  to  provide  services  to  these

Introduced on the 7th day of June, 2013 by:
Honorable Shane Cohn, Alderman 25th Ward

Resolution No. 62
Breaking Through

WHEREAS,  in  the  film  Breaking
Through, openly LGBT elected officials at all
levels - including the first gay US Senator,
Tammy Baldwin - share their stories of self-
doubt  and  triumph  over  multiple  barriers
ranging from race and poverty to gender and
sexual orientation, revealing a deeply personal,
rarely-seen side of politicians and gay people;
and

though 

WHEREAS, 

featuring
politicians, it isn’t about politics: it’s about
people who feel fear and shame, yearning to
live meaningful lives; and

WHEREAS, they reveal with surprising
vulnerability how they broke through internal
and external barriers to achieve the future they
envisioned.  By  showing  that  “anything  is
possible,” they impact those from any walk
of life who are struggling and seek to prevent
them from taking their own lives or living in
repressed, depressed conditions; and

WHEREAS,  Cindy  L. Abel  formed
Atlantis  Moon  Productions  in  2007  to
develop  film-related  projects  that  launch
conversations and impact popular culture. Her
first  full-length  documentary,  the  award-
winning film Breaking Through, was conceived
in response to the high number of teens who
were taunted because of being gay or perceived
to be and committing suicide. Having struggled
with coming out, Abel knew the importance
of having positive role models and wanted to
highlight  openly  LGBT  leaders  living
authentic and fulfilled lives.

NOW  THEREFORE  BE 

IT
RESOLVED by the Board of Aldermen of
the City of St. Louis that we pause in our
deliberations to recognize the film Breaking
Through and we further direct the Clerk of
this Board to spread a copy of this Resolution
across the minutes of these proceedings and
to prepare a commemorative copy to the end
that it may be presented at a time and place
deemed appropriate by the Sponsor.

WHEREAS, Jan Clinite was elected 15th
Ward Committeewoman in August of 2008
