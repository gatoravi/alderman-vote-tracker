President Reed introduced Resolutions
No.  225  through  229  and  the  Clerk  was
instructed to read same.

Resolution No. 225

250th Birthday of the City of St. Louis
WHEREAS, legend has it that on or
about February 14, 1764,  Rene’ Auguste
Chouteau  (more  commonly  Auguste
Chouteau), a French lad 14 years old, co-
founded the great City of St. Louis with his
stepfather Pierre de Laclede Liguest (more
commonly Pierre Laclede) and 30 other men
who cleared a site at what would later become
the foot of Walnut Street and which had been
selected in November1763 as a fur trading
outpost  to  exercise  a  French  fur  trading
monopoly grant in the Missouri Region; and
WHEREAS, the selection of St. Louis
was political and practical from the beginning.
What was to be a fur trading outpost became
the Village of St. Louis when Fort de Chartes
on  the  east  side  of  the  Mississippi  River,
where Pierre Laclede & Auguste Chouteau
were wintering, was turned over to the British
in 1763, so it was resolved to go to the west
bank of the Mississippi River, which they
believed to be controlled by France.  Once
finding  the  area  at  the  confluence  of  the
Missouri & Mississippi Rivers too marshy,
Pierre Laclede moved 15 miles downriver to
the  first  elevated  and  accessible  site  of
woodland and prairie area; and

WHEREAS, the advantages of the site
of our City of St. Louis and its great region
have been known at least as far back as the

Mississippian  Culture  of  the  8th  to  12th
centuries with vestiges of that culture reflected
in the remaining Cahokia Mounds in Illinois
and the one Sugar Loaf Mound remaining in
St. Louis from a network of Mounds that once
provided the appellation of our fair city as
Mound City.  Pierre Laclede prophetically
pronounced (translated):  “I HAVE FOUND
A SITUATION WHERE I AM GOING TO
FORM A SETTLEMENT WHICH MIGHT
BECOME, HEREAFTER, ONE OF THE
FINEST  CITIES  IN AMERICA  —  SO
MANY ADVANTAGES ARE EMBRACED
IN  ITS  SITE,  BY  ITS  LOCALITY AND
CENTRAL  POSITION,  FOR  FORMING
SETTLEMENTS.”

WHEREAS, the City of St. Louis was
named after King Louis IX of France, patron
saint of King Louis XV, whom Pierre Laclede
had served as a soldier before leaving Bedous,
France; and

WHEREAS, the once small village of
St. Louis became the Gateway to the West
and the host of the Olympics and  Louisiana
Purchase Exposition (World’s Fair) in 1904;
it is now a center of commerce; transportation
hub; a progressing leader in biotechnology and
life sciences; host of medical research; center
of higher education; recognized entrepreneurial
center; known for financial services; home of
a world famous zoo, botanical garden, art
museum, and science center; and boasts a
number of  Fortune 500 companies; and

WHEREAS,  whether  you  call  it  a
sestercentennial,  semiquincentennial,  or
bicenquinquagenary,  ST.  LOUIS  IS
CELEBRATING ITS 250TH BIRTHDAY
ON FEBRUARY 14, 2014, and preparing for
its better days to come.

NOW  THEREFORE  BE 

IT
RESOLVED  that  we  pause  in  our
deliberations to recognize the 250th birthday
of the City of St. Louis and the St. Louis
region.  We hope that all will celebrate this
momentous occasion, take this opportunity
to be grateful for all of the blessings bestowed
on our region, and fly the flag of the City of
St. Louis. We further direct the Clerk of the
Board to spread a copy of this Resolution
across the minutes of the proceedings and
further to prepare two commemorative copies
to the end that one may be presented to the
full Board of Aldermen and the other to the
Mayor, both for permanent display in the
Board of Aldermen Chambers and City Hall
Rotunda, respectively.

Resolution No. 227

MAZE FEATURING FRANKIE BEVERLY
WHEREAS, a native of Philadelphia,
Frankie Beverly grew up singing in church.
Frankie  later  formed  a  group  called  The
Butlers,  eventually  changing  the  name  to
Frankie Beverly’s Raw Soul. The band’s star
began to rise when Marvin Gaye caught their
show and took them on the road as his opening
act. Gaye urged them to change their name
and Roame, one of the original members, came
up with the name Maze and the rest is music
history; and

WHEREAS, Maze featuring Frankie
Beverly arrived on the scene in 1977 with a
string of hits including Happy Feelings, Lady
of  Magic, While  I’m Alone  and Workin’
‘Together.  The soul classics continued with
Golden Time of Day, Southern Girl, Joy and
Pain, We Are One, Running Away, Back In
Stride, Can’t Get Over You, Silky Soul and
The Morning After; and

WHEREAS, for more than 40 years,
MAZE featuring Frankie Beverly has stayed
in its lane, bringing quality music from the

heart night after night, establishing a trust with
music lovers worldwide. Fans know when
they attend a Maze concert they will be treated
to an evening of honest, raw soul music, with
no gimmicks, no stage tricks, just Beverly with
his smooth, soulful vocals supported by the
tight Maze band; and

WHEREAS,  Beverly’s  biggest
inspirations Frankie Lymon, Sam Cooke and
another  original  Maze  member  the  late
McKinley  “Bug”  Williams,  who  played
percussions  and  sang  background,  had
tremendous  impact  on  Beverly  for  their
commitment to fans. To this day, he always
makes time for his fans, family and friends by
being kind and patient just as those legends
were that came before him; and

NOW  THEREFORE  BE 

IT
RESOLVED by the Board of Aldermen for
the City of St. Louis that we pause in our
deliberations to recognize Frankie Beverly and
Maze  for  their  contributions  and  selfless
dedication to the sound of soul music, and the
years of love they have shown to St. Louis
and we further direct the Clerk of this Board
to prepare a commemorative copy of this
resolution to the end that it may be presented
to our honorees at a time and place deemed
appropriate by the sponsor.

presence  of  such  bidders  as  desire  to  be
present, and shall be open to the inspection
of bidders.

B.  The  bids  shall  not  be  materially

from a non-local bidder. When the lowest bid
is from a non-local bidder, any local bidder
