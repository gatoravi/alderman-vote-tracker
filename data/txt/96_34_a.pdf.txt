Pacific Educational Group’s

Fifth Annual Summit for
Courageous Conversation
WHEREAS, the team of dedicated and
talented staff of Pacific Educational Group
has  partnered  with  school  districts,
universities and educational organizations
throughout the U.S., Canada and Australia in
fostering  the  development  of  greater
awareness,  skills  and  accountability  in
educating  all  students  and  especially
underserved students of color since 1992; and

have shown that racial achievement disparities
in public education have persisted for nearly
a century, and current data indicates that (a)

Native and Hawaiian Native/Pacific Island
counterparts, and (b) educational achievement
disparities  between  White  students  and
students of color have reached unprecedented,
alarmingly high levels; and

WHEREAS, Pacific Educational Group
believes  that  systemic  racism  is  the  most
devastating  factor  contributing  to  the
diminished capacity of children of color to
achieve at the highest levels, and contributes
to  the  fracturing  of  the  communities  that
nurture and support them; and

WHEREAS, the staff and affiliates of
Pacific Educational Group strive to prepare
leaders, be they governing board members,
administrators, teachers, students, parents or
community  members,  to  be  effective  and
courageous advocates for eliminating the racial
predictability of which student groups occupy
the highest and lowest achievement categories;
and

WHEREAS, the Summit for Courageous
Conversation  convenes  leaders  for  racial
equity from the U.S. and around the world to
engage, sustain and deepen interracial dialogue
about the impact of race on schooling and to
discover effective strategies for unlocking the
untapped potential of underserved children
of color and their White peers.

IT
RESOLVED by the Board of Aldermen of
the City of St. Louis that we pause in our
deliberations to recognize Pacific Educational
Group’s Fifth Annual Summit for Courageous
Conversation and we further direct the Clerk

19th Anniversary Celebration for

Pastor Curtis Scott &

WHEREAS, Pastor Dorothy J. Scott
and Curtis W. Scott, both were called to become
ministers early in their marriage. They both
served tirelessly over the years as members

and teach God’s Word whenever and wherever
needed; and

open their own church in a little church by the
side of the road at 8026 Ellerton. When they
opened their doors they had half a dozen souls.

did they contact friends to join them. They
knew if they unselfishly served God, He would
do  the  rest.  After  much  prayer  and
contemplation they were able to grow and
serve in their small church house with over
twenty five members; and

were able to relocate to a new church building
located at 3616 Bates. Their ministry grew
even more to over sixty members. Christ said,

the gates of hell shall not prevail against it”,
Matthew 16:18. Sadly, three years later Pastor
Dorothy Scott passed away after a long battle
with Leukemia; and

WHEREAS, Pastor Dorothy was and
is  still  dearly  missed,  Pastor  Curtis  Scott
continued as the Lord wanted him to do. The
church went through many changes after her
passing, but the congregation continues to
serve and be a church driven by God. Under
the direction of Pastor Scott the membership
is again on the increase.  He never lost sight of
the fact that the most important goal of his
ministry was to bring souls to Christ by the
Word of God. Pastor Scott is celebrating his
19th year as Pastor of Lighthouse Christian

NOW  THEREFORE  BE 

Ministry and also celebrating the 19th year of

to the opening of bids, codified as Section
5.58.040 of the Revised Code of the City of

provision  on  the  same  subject  matter;

WHEREAS,  by  enacting  a  local
