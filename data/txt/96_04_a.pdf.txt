The  Board  of  Police  Commissioners
reserves the right to waive any formalities and
to reject any and all bids.  The Board also
reserves the right to consider criteria other
than the low bid in the award of a contract.
Among other factors, the Board will consider
the location of the business, minority interest
in the business, prior performance and the bid
submitted in relation to the needs of the St.
Louis Metropolitan Police Department.

Bidders are hereby advised that the St.
Louis Living Wage Ordinance #65597 and
associated  Regulations  could  apply  to  the
service for which bids are being sought herein.
This Ordinance requires that, unless specific
exemptions apply, all individuals who perform
work pursuant to a contract executed between
the successful bidder and the City must be
paid a minimum of the applicable Living Wage
rates and if rates are adjusted during the term
of  the  contract  pursuant  to  the  Ordinance,
applicable rates after such adjustment is made.
Each bidder must submit the “Living Wage
Acknowledgment and Acceptance Declaration
with the bid.  Failure to submit this Declaration
with the bid will result in rejection of the bid.
A successful bidder’s failure to comply with
the contract provisions related to the Living
Wage Ordinance may result in termination of
the contract and the imposition of additional
penalties  as  set  for  in  the  Ordinance  and
Regulations.

Copies of the Ordinance and Regulations
are available upon request from Carol Shepard,
at  314-444-5608  or  can  be  accessed  at

Bidders are also advised that the State
of Missouri requires workers on all public
works projects to be paid prevailing wages.
The contractor will forfeit a penalty to the
contracting public body of $100 per day (or
portion of a day) if a worker is paid less than
the prevailing rate for any work done under
the  contract  by  the  contractor  or  by  any
subcontractor  (Section  290.250,  RSMo.).
Also, if a vendor would like to receive a bid
please email a request to bnturner@slmpd.org.
