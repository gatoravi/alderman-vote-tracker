Resolution No. 262

Pastor Carvin Donald Sharp
WHEREAS, Carvin Donald Sharp was
a Northsider through and through.  In his
younger days he was stronger and smarter
than most and so he lived for himself.  As a
product  of  the  hippie  movement,  Don’s
concept of love was that if you don’t cross
him,  he  wouldn’t  cross  you.    But  all  that
changed in 1982; and

WHEREAS, Don Sharp met Jesus.  The
former atheist ran up and down his street
crying out “It’s true It’s TRUE!  He never
looked back.  God transformed this man and
his perception of love; and

WHEREAS, he would spend the rest of
his life at a small church in Baden called The
Church of God at Baden.  During those early
years God began to give Don a heart that loved
people, especially the poor and downtrodden;
and

WHEREAS, he started feeding homeless
people with his family at night.  This only
increased his hunger to help those in need.  So
Don began bringing these new ministries to
The Church of God at Baden; and

WHEREAS, in 1994 the church elected
Don  as  their  Pastor.    Pastor  Don’s  heart
radically changed the mission and focus of
that little church.  The ministry began to focus
far less with its walls and far more outside of
them, into the community; and

WHEREAS,  under  Pastor  Don’s
inspiration and leadership, the Church of God
at Baden began an official Homeless Ministry,
a  Food  Bank,  Telephone  Ministry  and  a
Clothing  Ministry.    The  church  began
delivering Meals on Wheels during the holidays
when the program was not available.  Pastor
Don also began providing transportation for
elders to events in Baden; and

WHEREAS, his heart for the needy,
downtrodden and often forgotten souls was
evident in his leading of Recovery Group
meetings  and  Rehabilitation/Addiction

outreach.  His counseling was sought by many
from all walks of life.  But it was his love,
compassion and acceptance of people “right
where they are” that drew in the hurting souls;
and

WHEREAS, Pastor Don spearheaded
the Church of God at Baden’s “Jesus in the
City” annual festival.  He wanted this outreach
to  draw  people  in  from  the  county  to
participate  in  ministering  to  the  Baden
neighborhood.    The  festival  includes  live
music, free clothing, food and many activities
for children; and

WHEREAS, he was the Chairman of the
Board  for  the  Baden  Christian  Childcare
Center.  Through his ministry, he was able to
assist and interact with many parents in North
St. Louis over the years.  Those relationships
didn’t end when the children grew up; and

WHEREAS, of course, as Pastor, he led
numerous Bible studies on different days that
were personalized and themed for the needs
of  the  attendees.    His  Sunday  morning
messages were always dipped in the message
of loving your neighbor as yourself and loving
your God with all your heart.  He preached
the gospel in our 13 missionary churches in
Japan.  When the Japanese Pastors came to
visit Baden, Pastor Don involved them in all
of our street ministries; and

WHEREAS,  his  heart  and  mission
extended far beyond the bounds of a church
and the title “Pastor”.  If he had money in his
pocket, he gave it away.  His home was always
shelter for low income and homeless people.
But most importantly, he was genuine.  If
you met him, you could call him friend; and
WHEREAS, for those of us who knew
him day to day, we just called him Don.  The
Pastor title was unnecessary because the love
of God so permeated this man, you couldn’t
help but notice.  He had one motivation and
that was to serve God.  His successful life is
evidenced now in the words of those who
knew him - “He was the perfect example of
what I think a Christian ought to be”.

NOW  THEREFORE  BE 

IT
RESOLVED by the Board of Aldermen of
the  City  of  St.  Louis  that  we  pause  to
remember the many contributions of Pastor
Carvin Donald Sharp  to the citizens of the
City of St. Louis and we join with his many
friends in expressing our sorrow at his passing,
and we further direct the Clerk of this Board
to spread a copy of this Resolution across the
minutes of these proceedings and to prepare a
memorial copy for presentation to the Sharp
family, at a time and place deemed appropriate
