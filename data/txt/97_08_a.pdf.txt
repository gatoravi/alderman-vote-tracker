discharged from the Army he went on to further
serve his country in the United States Coast
Guard; and

WHEREAS, when his service with the

as a member of the American Legion.  For the
past 25 years he has served in many positions.
He was Post Commander in 1998 and again in
2009.  He has been Post Adjutant for at least
ten years, plus he has at one time or another
been elected to every office in the post.  He
was instrumental in forming the Legionette
Dance Team, and also the practice of giving
chits to the patients at the Jefferson Barracks
V.A. Hospital.  Skip worked for a number of
years with the Soldiers Memorial and has
served as the Chaplain with the District Guard

he served as the Chaplain for many years, and
was also the Sergeant-at-Arms; and

memorial has reached a significant goal of
preserving a vital piece of St. Louis history to
honor the fallen WWI soldiers and the mothers
who loved them.  After WWI the Gold Star
Mothers of St. Louis created a Court of Honor,
with bronze medallions set into the parkway
in  the  middle  of  North  Kingshighway

WHEREAS,  in  the  1980’s  these
medallions were being thrown away.  Skip,
along with other members of Rolla-Calcaterra,
Post 15 saved 752 of the original 1,185 bronze
plaques and he personally documented the
433 that were lost.  Since that time Skip has
had a single mission to find an appropriate
home for the medallions.  As of September
30, 2012 his mission has been fulfilled.  That
Sunday, which was also Gold Star Mother’s
Day, was the day the World War I Court of
Honor Memorial was officially dedicated at
Jefferson Barracks National Cemetery.  This
was  also  the  day  Skip’s  dreams  became
finalized; and

a truck in memory of L. Cpl. Phillip Vinnedge
a Marine who lost his life in Iraq.  Julie,
Phillip’s mother is also the president of the
St. Louis Gold Star Mothers; and

Louis,  Department  of  Missouri,  of  the
American Legion is happy and pleased to
bestow upon Frank “Skip” Berger, the honor
of Legionnaire of the Year 2014.

5.58.040 - Opening of bids.
A. Proposals shall be opened at the time
and place fixed by the advertisement, in the
presence  of  such  bidders  as  desire  to  be
present, and shall be open to the inspection
of bidders.

B.  The  bids  shall  not  be  materially
modified or amended as to price, specification
or otherwise, nor substitutions placed thereon,
after opening except when the lowest bid is
from a non-local bidder. When the lowest bid
is from a non-local bidder, any local bidder
within two percent of the lowest bid may
match the lowest bid. If a local bidder matches
the lowest bid, then the Supply Commissioner
may select the bid from the local bidder. If
more  than  one  local  bidder  is  within  two
percent of the lowest bid, then only the lowest
local bidder may match the bid. In all other
circumstances, modification, supplementation
or amendment shall cause rejection of the bid.
For purposes of this chapter, local bidder
means  a  bidder  whose  principal  place  of
business is within the City of St. Louis, has
had a valid business license for at least one
year, and is current in payment of local taxes.
Principal place of business shall be defined as
the business’s physical office, plant, or site
where  a  majority  (51%)  of  the  full-time
employees, chief officer, and managers of the
business regularly work and conduct business,
or where the plant or office and equipment
required for the furnishing of the goods or
performance of the services provided to the
City, as required by the contract, are physically
located in the City of St. Louis for at least one
taxable year immediately prior to the date of
the bid.

C. Bids may be for one or more or all the
articles advertised for, but there shall be a
specific bid on each article. The award may be
made to the lowest bidder for any article, or
to the lowest bidder for the entire requisition
or  any  part  thereof,  but  the  Board  of
Standardization may reject any or all bids or
