Murphy “Pete” O’Malley; and

of St. Gabriel the Archangel Parish, where he
attends daily Mass.  He is a member of the
Ghouls Athletic Club, a group that started in
a  room  over  a  garage  in  the  Parkview
Neighborhood with about 15 teenage boys in
1940.  The Ghouls grew to more than 25
members and the girlfriends and wives of the
Ghouls started the WAGs, Women’s Auxiliary
Ghouls.   These were, and are, George’s best
friends.   George was an avid tennis player
and ranked in St. Louis at one time.  He had to
stop playing at age 85 when Helen Jane got
too ill and George did not want to leave her
side.

“who saw the hunger and the passion that I
had for my son — and that I wanted to take it
to the next level.”; and

WHEREAS,  Mr.  Davis  credits  the
program with teaching him how to be a better
father  on  many  levels  —  from  how  to
discipline, to how to develop a friendship with
his child, to how to talk “to” and not “at” his
son.  But,  most  of  all,  Davis  says,  “The
program gave me a better look at myself” and
allowed him “to be more caring and more
loving” — not only with his son, but with
other fathers struggling in the community; and
WHEREAS, since 2012, Mr. Davis has
had  full  custody  of  his  son,  12-year-old,
Markel. The father and son live together in a
two-bedroom townhouse.

 WHEREAS, Markel says he likes living
with his dad, whom he calls “really funny.”
The 7th-grade basketball player also enjoys
playing, and regularly beating, his father in
“Tips”; and

WHEREAS, When he’s not working at
his job as a deli clerk at Schnucks or spending
time with Markel, Mr. Davis often returns to
Fathers’ Support Center to speak to the men
currently in the program; and

WHEREAS, as a man always looking to
make his audience laugh, Mr. Davis knows
the power of a positive attitude.

NOW  THEREFORE  BE 

IT
RESOLVED by the Board of Aldermen of
the City of St. Louis that we pause in our
deliberations to recognize Mr. Marvin Davis
for  being  honored  as  Father’s  Support
Center’s Father of the Year and we further
direct the Clerk of this Board to spread a copy

June 24, 2014

appropriate by the Sponsor.

Resolution No. 80

Mrs. Laurena Wiggins

WHEREAS, Mrs. Laurena Wiggins, a
beautiful smile and a giving heart passed away
on Monday, June 9, 2014 at the age of 77; and
WHEREAS, she was born April 16,
1937 in Carr Square Village in St. Louis,
Missouri and later moved to 2011 East Alice;
and

WHEREAS, Laurena was the proud
mother of five children: one daughter and four
sons.  She was also extremely proud of her
seven  grandchildren  and  nine  great-
grandchildren who she never stopped talking
about; and

WHEREAS, Laurena always had a smile
no matter what was going on in her life and
would always there to give everyone else
words of encouragement; and

WHEREAS,  she  was  extremely
instrumental in the community in helping
young mothers care for their children as she
owned Wiggins Daycare for over forty years;
and

WHEREAS,  the  daycare  was  not  a
babysitting business, the love and caring she
provided far exceeded that of any babysitter
and there was always a waiting list of people
wanting her to care for their children; and

WHEREAS, Laurena always treated
everyone who crossed her path as family, all
she ever knew to give was her love and she
was one of a kind.

remember the many contributions of  Laurena
Wiggins to the citizens of the City of St. Louis

expressing our sorrow at her passing, and we
further direct the Clerk of this Board to spread
a copy of this Resolution across the minutes
of these proceedings and to prepare a memorial
copy for presentation to the Wiggins family,
at a time and place deemed appropriate by
the Sponsor.

to the opening of bids, codified as Section
5.58.040 of the Revised Code of the City of
St. Louis, and enacting a new provision on the
same subject matter which allows a local bidder
to match the lowest bid when the lowest bid
is from a non-local bidder; enacting a new
provision  on  the  same  subject  matter;
containing severability clause.

the City and to relocate to the City;

WHEREAS,  by  enacting  a  local
preference law that allows a local firm to match

may select the bid from the local bidder. If
more  than  one  local  bidder  is  within  two
percent of the lowest bid, then only the lowest
local bidder may match the bid. In all other

had a valid business license for at least one
year, and is current in payment of local taxes.

the business’s physical office, plant, or site
where  a  majority  (51%)  of  the  full-time
employees, chief officer, and managers of the
business regularly work and conduct business,
or where the plant or office and equipment
required for the furnishing of the goods or
performance of the services provided to the
