COURTESY RESOLUTIONS

CONSENT CALENDAR

President Reed introduced Resolutions
No. 64 through 69 and the Clerk was instructed
to read same.

Resolution No. 64
Voices for Children

WHEREAS,  the  Court Appointed
Special Advocate (CASA) movement began
in  1977  when  a  Seattle  judge  became
increasingly frustrated about making decisions
for children of abuse when he didn’t have
enough  information.    Sadly,  the  case  that
launched the CASA movement involved a child
who died while under custody of the State of
Washington; and

WHEREAS,  in  1980,  the  National
Council  of  Jewish  Women  (NCJW)  was
granted permission to serve as the lead agency
in  piloting  a  CASA  program  in  St.  Louis
County. The organization’s advocacy efforts
proved to be a viable and important part of
the county’s child welfare system and in 1995,
CASA  was  incorporated  as  a  501(c)3
organization; and

 WHEREAS, St. Louis City’s CASA
program was established in 1984, when the
St.  Louis  City  Family  court  Established  a
Volunteer  Guardian  ad  Litem  (VGAL)
program to provide a representative at every
family court hearing for child victims of abuse
and neglect. The work of the VGAL program
was  coordinated  by  the Women’s  Crusade
Against Crime; and

WHEREAS, in 1998, at the urging of
the court after the dissolution of the Crusade,
St. Louis City CASA was incorporated as a
501(c)3 organization. St. Louis City CASA
changed its name to Voices for Children in
2005 to better articulate its mission. Over its
30-year history, these two organizations have
helped several thousand kids achieve safety,
stability and a more hopeful future; and

  WHEREAS,  in  July  of    2011,  the
boards  of  CASA  of  St.  Louis  County  and
Voices for Children approved the merger of
the two organizations. This historic decision
followed nearly 18 months of deliberation and
brings  the  collective  resources  of  both
organizations together to give all St. Louis
foster children a stronger voice.
NOW  THEREFORE 

IT  BE
RESOLVED by the Board of Aldermen of
the City of St. Louis that we pause in our
deliberations to recognize Voices for Children
and we further direct the Clerk of this Board
to include a copy of this Resolution in the

minutes of these proceedings and to prepare a
memorial copy for presentation at a time and
place deemed appropriate by the Sponsor.

WHEREAS,  David’s  37  year  career
with  the  St.  Louis  Public  School  District
spanned working as an elementary classroom
teacher,  writer/producer/announcer for KSLH
radio  station,  research  statistician  for  the
Federal Programs Office, Assistant Principal
at Clay Elementary School and Principal at
Long Middle School for 19 years; and

WHEREAS, in his retirement, David

Resolution No. 67

ST. ANTHONY OF PADUA CATHOLIC

CHURCH 150TH ANNIVERSARY
WHEREAS,  SAINT ANTHONY  OF
PADUA  CATHOLIC  CHURCH 
is
celebrating its Sesquicentennial anniversary as
a  parish  at  Compton  and  Meramec  in  the
Dutchtown neighborhood of South St. Louis;
and

WHEREAS,  ST.  ANTHONY  OF
PADUA  CATHOLIC  CHURCH  was
founded at the invitation of Archbishop Peter
Richard Kenrick by Fr. Servace Altmicks, OSF
and three other Franciscan Friars from Saxony,
Germany to serve the German and English
speaking families — mostly farmers — living
in the Dutchtown area between Sts. Peter &
Paul in Soulard and St. Bonaface in Carondelet,
but  today  serves  many  families  of  great
diversity,  including  immigrants  from
throughout the world in an urban setting; and
WHEREAS, the ambitious mission of
SAINT  ANTHONY  OF 
PADUA
CATHOLIC  CHURCH  today  includes
recognition of its place in the community as
the  “cornerstone 
in  our  changing
neighborhood of south St. Louis” and the work
of the parish reflects the call of St. Francis of
Assisi  to  “rebuild  my  Church”  and  the
simplicity of preaching the true gospel as St.
Anthony of Padua did in 13th century Italy;
and

WHEREAS, the first Mass of the parish
is chronicled as occurring on February 5, 1863
in a small frame house donated by parishioner
John  Withnell,  and  a  permanent  church  in
Gothic style, composed of limestone quarried
from down on S. Broadway off Meramec, was
then built with the cornerstone blessed in 1864;
and

WHEREAS, the “new” current church
building was constructed in Romanesque style
with twin spires that can be seen for miles
atop  its  hill  at  Meramec  and  Michigan,
boasting magnificent stained glass windows
by Emil Frei, including the marvel of modern
electric lights outlining the sacristy on special
occasions, with a cornerstone laid on July 4,
1908,  and  opening  in  1910  with  a  seating
capacity  of  1400  (double  that  of  the  old
church) and costing $175,000; and

WHEREAS, the religious mettle of the
parish has been tested on numerous occasions,
including the great fire of April 28, 1994, when
lightning struck the church, setting the roof
on fire; the building survived the blaze and
subsequent water damage, and restoration was
immediately undertaken at the direction of

Cardinal Justin Rigali who witnessed the fire;
Christmas Mass was celebrated in the church
building  in  1995  and  full  restoration  was
complete in April 1996; and

WHEREAS, members of the parish have
always taken upon themselves the corporal
works of caring for their neighbors through
such efforts as the St. Vincent DePaul Society,
food panty, and other programs.

NOW  THEREFORE  BE 

IT
RESOLVED by the Board of Aldermen for
the City of St. Louis that we pause in our
deliberations  to  recognize  the  150th  year

Jesus Centennial Celebration
WHEREAS, the Apostles of the Sacred
Heart of Jesus, an international congregation
of  Catholic  sisters,  announce  the  100th
anniversary of the arrival of their order in St.
Louis; and

WHEREAS, the year 2013 marks the
100th anniversary of the arrival of the Apostles
of  the  Sacred  Heart  of  Jesus  in  St.  Louis,
Missouri.  Five  Sisters  journeyed  from
Connecticut to this Midwestern city for the
same reason the Apostles had traveled to the
U.S.  from  Italy  in  1902:  to  serve  Italian
immigrants who were struggling and to preserve
their Catholic, moral, and cultural life in the
“New World”; and

WHEREAS, Fr. Cesar Spigardi, Pastor
of Our Lady Help of Christians, or “the Italian
Church” as it was deemed, reached out to the
Apostles whom he had met while giving a
mission in New Haven, Connecticut, in 1912.
He  saw  in  the  Sisters  the  zeal  and  charity
necessary to help him renew the faith of his
flock. The Apostles arrived in St. Louis on
January 24, 1913, and  began teaching in the
new  parish  school,  educating  the  Italian
immigrant  children,  evangelizing,  and
providing pastoral care to their families. From
downtown, the Sisters’ mission expanded to

Jesus have served in more than 35 schools,
parishes, and other ministries in the greater
St. Louis area; and

WHEREAS, the centennial celebration
will begin with a Mass of Thanksgiving on
Sunday, June 30, 2013 at St. Francis Xavier
College Church with Archbishop Robert J.
Carson as celebrant.  There will be a reception
immediately following the Mass in the Xavier
