President  Reed introduced Resolution
No.  174  through  180  and  the  Clerk  was
instructed to read same.

Resolution No. 174

Mr. Damon Dwight Lovett Jr.
WHEREAS, Mr. Damon Dwight Lovett
Jr. was born on August 4, 1997 in Saint Louis,
Missouri to Shayla Verges and Damon Lovett.
Damon walked into the loving arms of GOD
Wednesday, November 19, 2014, at the age of
seventeen.  Damon was preceded in death by
his paternal grandmother, the late Carolyn
Smith; great grandmother, the late Yvonne
Sharpe; and his best friend and cousin, Ryan
James Thurman; and

WHEREAS, Damon had the wonderful
experience of living in Orlando, Florida for
two years, 2008 to 2010.  He also had the
privilege  to  attend  an  accelerated  Middle
School in which Tiger Woods’ children also
attended.  Damon selected the trumpet as his
extra curriculum activity along with skate
boarding, swimming and hanging out with his
new diverse group of friends.  One friend in

particular, Rico Goss, took Damon in as an
older brother; and

WHEREAS,  Damon  found  a  new
passion for videogames and programming,
which he played intensely with his Uncle Chris
on a weekend basis.  Damon was also an avid
lover of sports, although he never physically
played any.  He attended Gateway High School
from 2012 to 2013, where he was an Air Force
Cadet  in  ROTC  before  transferring  to
Northwest High School and Beaumont High
School.  From 2013 to 2014, Damon dedicated
his  life  to  the  culinary  arts  and  cooking
gourmet dishes for his family to enjoy; and
WHEREAS,  Damon  will  be  greatly
missed by everyone that knew him.  He was
the kind of young man that anyone would be
proud to call their son, grandson and friend.
Damon  had  a  sarcasm  and  wit  that  was
undeniable.  He could make you cry, laugh
and mad with his joking and debates on topics
that stretched far and wide.  Damon was truly
the Brains of the operation, and Kayla was
his Pinky; and

NOW  THEREFORE  BE 

WHEREAS, Damon is survived by:  his
parents, Shayla Verges and stepfathers, Lavan
Goods and Benjamin Randle; two little sisters,
Kayla Miller and Kelsey Randle; great aunt,

Thurman; aunts, Danielle Kennedy and Tasha
Lovett; uncles, Grayling Smith Jr., Christopher
Smith, Aaron Verges, Stephon Verges and
Demetrius Lovett; cousins, Tanera Curtis-

RESOLVED by the Board of Aldermen of

remember Mr. Damon Dwight Lovett Jr. and
we join with his many friends in expressing
our sorrow at his passing, and we further direct
the Clerk of this Board to spread a copy of
this Resolution across the minutes of these

in our deliberations to recognize the members,
present and past, of the Centenary United
Methodist Church on the occasion of their
175th Anniversary; and

WHEREAS,  the  Centenary  United
Methodist  Church  has  been  providing
ministry to the downtown and metropolitan
St. Louis since 1839.  Initially, the church was
funded  by  the  hard  work  of  the  ladies
“society”, and therefore was known as the
“Ladies Church”; and

WHEREAS, when many congregations
were moving out west, Centenary made the
decision to stay in its downtown location on
December 31st, 1900,  allowing the church to
serve thousands of servicemen during World
War II due to its close proximity to Union
Station; and

WHEREAS, in the 1990’s, Centenary
made a commitment to welcome all people
regardless of race, ethnicity, marital status,
age or sexual orientation, making it the first
Reconciling  Congregation  of  the  United
Methodist Church in St. Louis; and

WHEREAS, today’s mission statement
is: “Centenary United Methodist Church is a
church of neighbors, committed to serving all
people whom God has placed in our midst
through  our  caring  presence  and  mindful
actions as demonstrated in the life of Jesus”;
and

NOW  THEREFORE  BE 

WHEREAS,  through  175  years,
Centenary has been instrumental in starting
new Methodist congregations, new service
agencies, and assisting individuals who are
called to the ministry, including three pastors
who became Bishops in the Methodist church;
for many years, the building housed the offices
of the Missouri Methodist Conference; and
WHEREAS, today, the Centenary hosts
the “Bridge” ministry who provides meals,
rest, and access to services to those in need.
In essence, “if you breathe you are welcome.”
IT
RESOLVED by the Board of Aldermen of
the City of St. Louis that being informed of
the upcoming anniversary party and wishing
to add our sincere congratulations we pause
in  our  deliberations  to  express  our

Honorable Judge Michael Calvin
WHEREAS, we pause to express our
sadness and offer condolences to the family
of long-time judge, the Honorable Michael

WHEREAS, Michael Byron Calvin was
born  February  16,  1951,  in  Nashville,
Tennessee, the oldest of Lincoln Byron Calvin
Sr.  and Thelma Vashti  Satterwhite’s  three
children.  His  father  was  a  pediatric
psychiatrist  and  his  mother  was  a  special
education teacher. The family moved to St.
Louis when he was 2, and he grew up on the
city’s north side near Natural Bridge Road
and Kingshighway; and

WHEREAS,  he  graduated  from
Beaumont  High  School  in  1968,  and
throughout the years, he volunteered with the
school’s  truancy  program.  In  1972,  he

to the governor for city court bench vacancies;
and

WHEREAS, one of the inveterate chess
player’s  best  moves  came  when  he  met
Vanessa Gardner at one of his favorite places:
a golf course. She was grateful when he offered
to advise her about a recent speeding ticket.
Not coincidentally, the information she shared
also enabled him to contact her later for a date.
They were married in 1987; and

WHEREAS, in addition to his wife and
daughter, the man who after 5 p.m. insisted
upon being called just plain ‘Mike’ (that’s
‘Uncle Mike’ for family) is survived by two

Calvin and a sister Robin (Kyle) Rutlin, both
of St. Louis.

to the opening of bids, codified as Section
5.58.040 of the Revised Code of the City of

same subject matter which allows a local bidder
to match the lowest bid when the lowest bid
is from a non-local bidder; enacting a new
provision  on  the  same  subject  matter;
containing severability clause.

higher administrative costs of doing business
in the City;

WHEREAS,  the  City  of  St.  Louis
desires to encourage businesses to remain in
the City and to relocate to the City;

WHEREAS,  by  enacting  a  local
preference law that allows a local firm to match

BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF

ST. LOUIS AS FOLLOWS:

SECTION  ONE.  Section  One,  part
86.040, Ordinance 56716 is hereby repealed.
SECTION  TWO.  Enacted  in  lieu

5.58.040 - Opening of bids.
A. Proposals shall be opened at the time
and place fixed by the advertisement, in the
presence  of  such  bidders  as  desire  to  be

of bidders.

B.  The  bids  shall  not  be  materially
modified or amended as to price, specification
or otherwise, nor substitutions placed thereon,
after opening except when the lowest bid is
from a non-local bidder. When the lowest bid
is from a non-local bidder, any local bidder
within two percent of the lowest bid may
match the lowest bid. If a local bidder matches
the lowest bid, then the Supply Commissioner
may select the bid from the local bidder. If
more  than  one  local  bidder  is  within  two
percent of the lowest bid, then only the lowest
local bidder may match the bid. In all other
circumstances, modification, supplementation
or amendment shall cause rejection of the bid.
For purposes of this chapter, local bidder
means  a  bidder  whose  principal  place  of
business is within the City of St. Louis, has
had a valid business license for at least one
year, and is current in payment of local taxes.
Principal place of business shall be defined as
the business’s physical office, plant, or site
where  a  majority  (51%)  of  the  full-time
employees, chief officer, and managers of the
business regularly work and conduct business,
or where the plant or office and equipment
required for the furnishing of the goods or
performance of the services provided to the
City, as required by the contract, are physically
located in the City of St. Louis for at least one
taxable year immediately prior to the date of
the bid.

C. Bids may be for one or more or all the
articles advertised for, but there shall be a
specific bid on each article. The award may be
made to the lowest bidder for any article, or
to the lowest bidder for the entire requisition
or  any  part  thereof,  but  the  Board  of
Standardization may reject any or all bids or
any part of any bid.

SECTION THREE. Severability.
The  provisions  of  this  section  are
severable. If any provision of this ordinance
is declared invalid, that invalidity shall not
affect other provisions of the ordinance which
can  be  given  effect  without  the  invalid
provision.
Approved: April 29, 2013

The right to reject any and all bids is

reserved
