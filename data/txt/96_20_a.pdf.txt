B.  The  bids  shall  not  be  materially

from a non-local bidder. When the lowest bid
is from a non-local bidder, any local bidder
within  two  percent  of  the  lowest  bid  may
match the lowest bid. If a local bidder matches
the lowest bid, then the Supply Commissioner
may select the bid from the local bidder. If
more  than  one  local  bidder  is  within  two
percent of the lowest bid, then only the lowest
local bidder may match the bid. In all other
circumstances, modification, supplementation
or amendment shall cause rejection of the bid.
For  purposes  of  this  chapter,  local  bidder

business is within the City of St. Louis, has
had a valid business license for at least one
year, and is current in payment of local taxes.
Principal place of business shall be defined as
the business’s physical office, plant, or site
where  a  majority  (51%)  of  the  full-time
employees, chief officer, and managers of the
business regularly work and conduct business,
or where the plant or office and equipment
required for the furnishing of the goods or
performance of the services provided to the
City, as required by the contract, are physically
located in the City of St. Louis for at least one
taxable year immediately prior to the date of
the bid.

Standardization may reject any or all bids or
any part of any bid.
