rail  through  St.  Louis  is  from  Bakken

strongly urges the Missouri Department of
Ecology  and  the  Military  Department
Emergency  Management  Division,  in

impact to public safety, the environment, the
economy, and traffic of petroleum transport
by the rail through St. Louis and the State of
Missouri.

SECTION  4.  The  City  of  St.  Louis
requests that the Governor of Missouri, the

to the opening of bids, codified as Section
5.58.040 of the Revised Code of the City of

provision  on  the  same  subject  matter;
containing severability clause.

businesses from other areas because of the
higher administrative costs of doing business
in the City;

WHEREAS,  the  City  of  St.  Louis
desires to encourage businesses to remain in
the City and to relocate to the City;

WHEREAS,  by  enacting  a  local
preference law that allows a local firm to match

percent of the lowest bid, the City hopes to
encourage and stimulate local business.

BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF

ST. LOUIS AS FOLLOWS:

SECTION  ONE.  Section  One,  part

presence  of  such  bidders  as  desire  to  be
present, and shall be open to the inspection
of bidders.

B.  The  bids  shall  not  be  materially
modified or amended as to price, specification
or otherwise, nor substitutions placed thereon,
after opening except when the lowest bid is
from a non-local bidder. When the lowest bid
is from a non-local bidder, any local bidder
within two percent of the lowest bid may
match the lowest bid. If a local bidder matches
the lowest bid, then the Supply Commissioner
may select the bid from the local bidder. If
more  than  one  local  bidder  is  within  two
percent of the lowest bid, then only the lowest
local bidder may match the bid. In all other

For purposes of this chapter, local bidder

business is within the City of St. Louis, has
had a valid business license for at least one
year, and is current in payment of local taxes.
Principal place of business shall be defined as

employees, chief officer, and managers of the
business regularly work and conduct business,
or where the plant or office and equipment
required for the furnishing of the goods or
performance of the services provided to the
City, as required by the contract, are physically
located in the City of St. Louis for at least one
taxable year immediately prior to the date of
the bid.

C. Bids may be for one or more or all the
articles advertised for, but there shall be a
specific bid on each article. The award may be
made to the lowest bidder for any article, or
to the lowest bidder for the entire requisition
or  any  part  thereof,  but  the  Board  of
Standardization may reject any or all bids or
any part of any bid.

SECTION THREE. Severability.
The  provisions  of  this  section  are
severable. If any provision of this ordinance
is declared invalid, that invalidity shall not
