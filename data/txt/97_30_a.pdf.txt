President Reed introduced Resolutions
No.  131  through  141  and  the  Clerk  was
instructed to read same.

Resolution No. 131

PLEASANT GROVE CHURCH

(CHURCH OF KOINONIA)

WHEREAS, Pleasant Grove Church
was founded in 1914 under the leadership of
the late Rev. Dan Davis, however, the church
was known at the time as Mt. Moriah.  The
church relocated several times throughout its
colorful history and moved to 19th Street and
was  renamed  Nineteenth  Street  Baptist
Church; and

WHEREAS, in 1937, Rev. Daniel C.
Davis  was  called  to  the  pastorate  by  the
faithful group of Mother Alice Edmondson,
Sister Viola Blevins McIntyre, Brother Louis
McIntyre,  Brother  Harry  McIntyre,  Sister
Reola McIntyre, Deacon Jeff McMillan, Sister
Hattie  McMillan,  Deacon  Ben  Sample,
Mother  Elizabeth  Sample,  sister  Mattie
Moore, Deacon Thomas Tate, Deacon Henry
Thomas, Sister Laura Wilson, and Sister Anna
Houston.  The church moved several times,
to include the 20th Street location (between
O’Fallon and Cass) and onto 23rd Street and
finally O’Fallon Avenue; and

WHEREAS, subsequently plans were
drawn  for  remodeling  and  the  name  was
changed  from  Nineteenth  Street  Baptist
Church to Pleasant Grove Missionary Baptist
Church.  On the first Sunday in January, 1954,
the church moved to 2407 Belle Glade.  The
church soon saw the need for a better building
and plans began to build a new church.  Three
houses  north  of  the  church  building  were
purchased and demolished.  It is on these lots
that our first edifice stands at 2411 Belle Glade
Avenue  (currently  known  as  the  Hildred
London Multipurpose Room). The pioneer
leader Rev. Daniel C. Davis retired after 45

years of Pastoral Leadership and the church
elected Rev. Spencer Wilford to serve as pastor
from  1983-1987,  Rev.  Spencer Wilford’s
ecclesiastical investment was a bridge that led
this congregation through a time of transition
and restructuring. In December of 1988, the
congregation elected Rev. Courtney A. Jones
(now elevated to the office of Bishop) pastor
of “the Grove”; and

WHEREAS, since then, the fellowship
has enjoyed an abundance of blessings from
the  Lord.    Bishop  Jones  has  helped  to
successfully navigate this ministry and its
congregants to grow by leaps and bounds,
spiritually,  physically  and  fiscally.  His
influence  with  other  pastors  and  political
leaders has addressed many of the issues facing
our communities internationally, nationally
and locally.  Bishop Jones, a visionary of God,
became a voice of revitalization in this, the
Greater Ville neighborhood, rebuilding its
cosmetic face.  New housing and renovation
began to occur in this historic area, reviving
its great legacy; and

WHEREAS,  in  2002,  the  Pleasant
Grove  Missionary  Baptist  Church  was
renamed Pleasant Grove Church (The Church
of Koinonia).  God led Pastor Jones (at this
stage of his ministry work) to the Full Gospel
Baptist Church Fellowship with Bishop Paul
S. Morton as presiding Bishop. On June 26,
2007, the Pleasant Grove Church celebrated
as their Pastor was consecrated Bishop of the
State of Missouri at the FGBCF International
Conference in Atlanta, Georgia.

NOW  THEREFORE  BE 

IT
RESOLVED by the Board of Aldermen of
the City of St. Louis that we pause in our

Missionary  Baptist  Church  and  we  wish

Resolution  across  the  minutes  of  these

to the opening of bids, codified as Section
5.58.040 of the Revised Code of the City of
St. Louis, and enacting a new provision on the
same subject matter which allows a local bidder
to match the lowest bid when the lowest bid
is from a non-local bidder; enacting a new
provision  on  the  same  subject  matter;
containing severability clause.

WHEREAS, local businesses which seek

Louis are at a competitive disadvantage with
businesses from other areas because of the
higher administrative costs of doing business
in the City;

WHEREAS,  the  City  of  St.  Louis
desires to encourage businesses to remain in
the City and to relocate to the City;

WHEREAS,  by  enacting  a  local
preference law that allows a local firm to match
the  lowest  bid  when  its  bid  is  within  2%

encourage and stimulate local business.

BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF

ST. LOUIS AS FOLLOWS:

SECTION  ONE.  Section  One,  part

5.58.040 - Opening of bids.
A. Proposals shall be opened at the time
and place fixed by the advertisement, in the
presence  of  such  bidders  as  desire  to  be
present, and shall be open to the inspection
of bidders.

B.  The  bids  shall  not  be  materially
modified or amended as to price, specification
or otherwise, nor substitutions placed thereon,
after opening except when the lowest bid is

is from a non-local bidder, any local bidder

    The City Journal

          21

may select the bid from the local bidder. If
more  than  one  local  bidder  is  within  two
percent of the lowest bid, then only the lowest
local bidder may match the bid. In all other
circumstances, modification, supplementation

For purposes of this chapter, local bidder

business is within the City of St. Louis, has
had a valid business license for at least one
year, and is current in payment of local taxes.
Principal place of business shall be defined as

employees, chief officer, and managers of the
business regularly work and conduct business,
or where the plant or office and equipment
required for the furnishing of the goods or
performance of the services provided to the
City, as required by the contract, are physically
located in the City of St. Louis for at least one
taxable year immediately prior to the date of
the bid.

C. Bids may be for one or more or all the
articles advertised for, but there shall be a
specific bid on each article. The award may be
made to the lowest bidder for any article, or
to the lowest bidder for the entire requisition
or  any  part  thereof,  but  the  Board  of
Standardization may reject any or all bids or
any part of any bid.
