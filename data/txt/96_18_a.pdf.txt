to the opening of bids, codified as Section
5.58.040 of the Revised Code of the City of

same subject matter which allows a local bidder
to match the lowest bid when the lowest bid
is from a non-local bidder; enacting a new
provision  on  the  same  subject  matter;
containing severability clause.

higher administrative costs of doing business
in the City;

WHEREAS,  the  City  of  St.  Louis
desires to encourage businesses to remain in

WHEREAS,  by  enacting  a  local
preference law that allows a local firm to match

encourage and stimulate local business.

is from a non-local bidder, any local bidder
within  two  percent  of  the  lowest  bid  may
match the lowest bid. If a local bidder matches
the lowest bid, then the Supply Commissioner
may select the bid from the local bidder. If
more  than  one  local  bidder  is  within  two
percent of the lowest bid, then only the lowest
local bidder may match the bid. In all other
