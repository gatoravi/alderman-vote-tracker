Resolution No. 122

Bishop Charlie Chatman
WHEREAS, Bishop Chatman was a
family man, the father of five children and the
husband of Queen Esther Chatman for fifty
three years and ten months; and

WHEREAS, he worked untiringly to
give them what he thought they deserved;
working many long over-time hours at the jobs
he held in order to add the little extras to their
lives; and

WHEREAS, Bishop Chatman was a
faithful man of God, dedicated to the work of
the Lord. Four years into his pasturing, he
became discouraged. With a handful of young
people and a mountain of bills he decided that
he had reached his limit; and

WHEREAS, Bishop Chatman told his
wife  that  he  wanted  to  go  on  vacation
somewhere he had never been; away from
churches, simply because he had no plans to
attend one while on vacation; and

WHEREAS, the Lord dealt with Sister
Chatman and told her to get him as close to
Chicago, IL as possible; and with the help of
her daughter they persuaded him to go out
and take pictures of Elder Richard Henton’s
newly purchased church of which she was
also a member; and

WHEREAS, on getting him there, he
took  out  his  camera  for  pictures.  Sister
Chatman ran up the steps and into church
service knowing Bishop would follow. Elder
Henton’s message was for him: “It’s worth
it.”  In the middle of the message Bishop
Chatman stood, raised his hands to God, and
cried “Yes!”; and

WHEREAS, from that day he never
looked backed, but pressed through every
obstacle, believing “it was worth it”; and

WHEREAS, Bishop was a humble man
who respected leadership and was loyal to
his leaders.  He went out of his way to be
obedient to do whatever he could.

WHEREAS, Bishop Chatman was an
achiever. He held a certificate from St. Louis
University in Electronics, diplomas from Basis
Institute of Technology and Data Processing

and various degrees from Saints Academy
Bible College: an Associates Degree in Biblical
Studies,  a  Bachelors  Degree  in  Christian
Ministries,  a  Masters  Degree  in  Christian
Education and an Honorary Doctors Degree
of Letters L.H.D.

NOW  THEREFORE  BE 

IT
RESOLVED by the Board of Aldermen of
the City of St. Louis that we pause in our
deliberations to join with his many friends
and family in expressing sorrow for the passing
of Bishop Charlie Chatman and we further
direct the Clerk of this Board to spread a copy
of this Resolution across the minutes of these
proceedings and to prepare a commemorative
copy to the end that it may be presented to
our  honoree  at  a  time  and  place  deemed
appropriate by the Sponsor.

Committee Substitute As Amended

An Ordinance repealing Section One,
part 86.040 of Ordinance 56716, pertaining
to the opening of bids, codified as Section
5.58.040 of the Revised Code of the City of
St. Louis, and enacting a new provision on the
same subject matter which allows a local bidder
to match the lowest bid when the lowest bid
is from a non-local bidder; enacting a new
provision  on  the  same  subject  matter;
containing severability clause.

WHEREAS, local businesses which seek
to enter into contracts with the City of St.
Louis are at a competitive disadvantage with
businesses from other areas because of the
higher administrative costs of doing business
in the City;

WHEREAS,  the  City  of  St.  Louis
desires to encourage businesses to remain in
the City and to relocate to the City;

WHEREAS,  by  enacting  a  local
preference law that allows a local firm to match
the  lowest  bid  when  its  bid  is  within  2%
percent of the lowest bid, the City hopes to
encourage and stimulate local business.

BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF

ST. LOUIS AS FOLLOWS:

SECTION  ONE.  Section  One,  part
86.040, Ordinance 56716 is hereby repealed.
SECTION  TWO.  Enacted  in  lieu

thereof is the following new section.

5.58.040 - Opening of bids.
A. Proposals shall be opened at the time
and place fixed by the advertisement, in the

presence  of  such  bidders  as  desire  to  be
present, and shall be open to the inspection
of bidders.

B.  The  bids  shall  not  be  materially
modified or amended as to price, specification
or otherwise, nor substitutions placed thereon,
after opening except when the lowest bid is
from a non-local bidder. When the lowest bid
is from a non-local bidder, any local bidder
within two percent of the lowest bid may
match the lowest bid. If a local bidder matches
the lowest bid, then the Supply Commissioner
may select the bid from the local bidder. If
more  than  one  local  bidder  is  within  two
percent of the lowest bid, then only the lowest
local bidder may match the bid. In all other
circumstances, modification, supplementation
or amendment shall cause rejection of the bid.
For purposes of this chapter, local bidder
means  a  bidder  whose  principal  place  of
business is within the City of St. Louis, has
had a valid business license for at least one
year, and is current in payment of local taxes.
Principal place of business shall be defined as
the business’s physical office, plant, or site
where  a  majority  (51%)  of  the  full-time
employees, chief officer, and managers of the
business regularly work and conduct business,
or where the plant or office and equipment
required for the furnishing of the goods or
performance of the services provided to the
City, as required by the contract, are physically
located in the City of St. Louis for at least one
taxable year immediately prior to the date of
the bid.

C. Bids may be for one or more or all the
articles advertised for, but there shall be a
specific bid on each article. The award may be
made to the lowest bidder for any article, or
to the lowest bidder for the entire requisition
or  any  part  thereof,  but  the  Board  of
Standardization may reject any or all bids or
any part of any bid.

SECTION THREE. Severability.
The  provisions  of  this  section  are
severable. If any provision of this ordinance
is declared invalid, that invalidity shall not
affect other provisions of the ordinance which
can  be  given  effect  without  the  invalid
provision.
Approved: April 29, 2013

The right to reject any and all bids is

reserved
