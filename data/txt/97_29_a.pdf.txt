President Reed introduced Resolutions
No.  128  through  130  and  the  Clerk  was
instructed to read same.

Resolution No. 128
The 30th Anniversary of

Central Reform Congregation
WHEREAS,  Central  Reform
Congregation started slowly, out of need. A
few bright young St. Louis area couples with
children nearing school age came to realize that
they needed to act if they were to raise them
as  Jews.  They  had  no  congregational
affiliations and the last nearby synagogue had
followed its congregants out and away from
the city limits. They did not like the idea of
having  the  City,  for  many  years  home  to
several dozen Jewish congregations, totally
devoid of a Jewish presence. These couples
wanted a special kind of Jewish home - a
community  where  they  could  raise  their

children, sing and dance and pray together.
They were looking for a community that was
inclusive, gender-neutral, non-patriarchal, and
spiritual; and

WHEREAS,  wedding  their  social
consciousness  to  their  burgeoning  Jewish
awareness, they decided, after much soul-
searching, to create a new Jewish place of
worship within the City of St. Louis. The
group  held  services  in  a  park  during  the
summer of 1984 to get people interested about
the  new  community.  Central  Reform
Congregation was founded in 1984, with 30
families attending their first High Holiday
services. The founding families chose the name
“Central Reform Congregation” because they
wanted the community to be both “central”
in City location and “Central” in their lives.
In 1985, CRC joined the Reform movement
by joining the UAHC (now the URJ, Union
for Reform Judaism); and

WHEREAS,  Rabbi  Susan  Talve
consulted with the founding families in 1984,
as they determined what kind of community
they wanted to create. In 1985, she was hired
as  a  part-time  rabbi  for  the  congregation.
Today, she serves the community as their
Senior Rabbi. Rabbi Randy Fleisher was hired
in 2000 to help meet the spiritual needs of
their growing community. And in 2008, Rabbi
Ed Harris, one of the founding members and
leaders for many years, was ordained as a
rabbi. Rabbi Ed continued to work as a private
practice psychologist and served part-time as
a rabbi at CRC; and

WHEREAS, thirty years later, believing
more  than  ever  that  a  desire  to  heal  and
transform the world demands that they not
flee the problems of the inner city, they revel
in  their  status  as  the  City’s  only  Jewish
congregation.  Their  voice  is  heard  in
discussions and plans for urban revitalization
and their hands are busy in a variety of efforts
aimed at revitalizing the area and improving
life for neighbors; and

WHEREAS, with the inspiration and
insightful teaching of Rabbi Susan Talve, Rabbi
Randy Fleisher, and Rabbi Ed Harris, and their
new Rabbi Deana Sussman, as well as the deep
commitment of lay leaders and members, they
have created a vital faith community that looks
for holy responses to all their life situations.
People who never knew what holiness was
are finding it in connecting with one another,
in worshiping together, in studying Torah
together,  and  in  coming  together  just  to
experience the shelter of peace that we create
together; and

WHEREAS, in 1999, they broke ground

NOW  THEREFORE  BE 

on their building in the Central West End. The
building - which they call Sukkat Shalom, or
“Shelter of Peace,” provides a holy space for
not only CRC programs but also for dozens
of community events throughout the year.
Each  year,  hundreds  of  youth  and  adults
participate in their education programs, and
thousands of individuals worship during the
High  Holidays,  on  Shabbat,  and  at  other
holiday  celebrations  throughout  the  year..
With no recruitment effort, membership rolls
grew exponentially, from 10 households in
1984 to approximately 750 households today.
IT
RESOLVED by the Board of Aldermen of
the City of St. Louis that we pause in our
deliberations to congratulate Central Reform
Congregation and wish them many more years
of success and we further direct the Clerk of
this Board to spread a copy of this Resolution
across the minutes of these proceedings and
to prepare a commemorative copy to the end
that it may be presented to our honoree at a
time and place deemed appropriate by the
Sponsor.

Committee Substitute As Amended

An Ordinance repealing Section One,
part 86.040 of Ordinance 56716, pertaining
to the opening of bids, codified as Section
5.58.040 of the Revised Code of the City of
St. Louis, and enacting a new provision on the
same subject matter which allows a local bidder
to match the lowest bid when the lowest bid
is from a non-local bidder; enacting a new
provision  on  the  same  subject  matter;
containing severability clause.

WHEREAS, local businesses which seek
to enter into contracts with the City of St.
Louis are at a competitive disadvantage with
businesses from other areas because of the
higher administrative costs of doing business
in the City;

WHEREAS,  the  City  of  St.  Louis
desires to encourage businesses to remain in
the City and to relocate to the City;

WHEREAS,  by  enacting  a  local
preference law that allows a local firm to match
the  lowest  bid  when  its  bid  is  within  2%
percent of the lowest bid, the City hopes to
encourage and stimulate local business.

BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF

ST. LOUIS AS FOLLOWS:

SECTION  ONE.  Section  One,  part
86.040, Ordinance 56716 is hereby repealed.
SECTION  TWO.  Enacted  in  lieu

5.58.040 - Opening of bids.

www.stlouis-mo.gov

A. Proposals shall be opened at the time
and place fixed by the advertisement, in the
presence  of  such  bidders  as  desire  to  be
present, and shall be open to the inspection
of bidders.

B.  The  bids  shall  not  be  materially
modified or amended as to price, specification
or otherwise, nor substitutions placed thereon,
after opening except when the lowest bid is
from a non-local bidder. When the lowest bid
is from a non-local bidder, any local bidder
within two percent of the lowest bid may
match the lowest bid. If a local bidder matches
the lowest bid, then the Supply Commissioner
may select the bid from the local bidder. If
more  than  one  local  bidder  is  within  two
percent of the lowest bid, then only the lowest
local bidder may match the bid. In all other
circumstances, modification, supplementation
or amendment shall cause rejection of the bid.
For purposes of this chapter, local bidder
means  a  bidder  whose  principal  place  of
business is within the City of St. Louis, has
had a valid business license for at least one
year, and is current in payment of local taxes.
Principal place of business shall be defined as
the business’s physical office, plant, or site
where  a  majority  (51%)  of  the  full-time
employees, chief officer, and managers of the
business regularly work and conduct business,
or where the plant or office and equipment
required for the furnishing of the goods or
performance of the services provided to the
City, as required by the contract, are physically
located in the City of St. Louis for at least one
taxable year immediately prior to the date of
the bid.

C. Bids may be for one or more or all the
articles advertised for, but there shall be a
specific bid on each article. The award may be
made to the lowest bidder for any article, or
to the lowest bidder for the entire requisition
or  any  part  thereof,  but  the  Board  of
Standardization may reject any or all bids or
any part of any bid.

SECTION THREE. Severability.
The  provisions  of  this  section  are
severable. If any provision of this ordinance
is declared invalid, that invalidity shall not
affect other provisions of the ordinance which
can  be  given  effect  without  the  invalid
provision.
Approved: April 29, 2013

The right to reject any and all bids is

reserved
